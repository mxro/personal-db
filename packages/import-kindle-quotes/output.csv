"Tara Brach","A LEGEND FROM ancient India tells of a musk deer who, one fresh spring day, detected a mysterious and heavenly fragrance in the air. It hinted of peace, beauty and love, and like a whisper beckoned him onward. Compelled to find its source, he set out, determined to search the whole world over. He climbed forbidding and icy mountain peaks, padded through steamy jungles, trekked across endless desert sands. Wherever he went, the scent was there, faint yet always detectable. At the end of his life, exhausted from his relentless search, the deer collapsed. As he fell his horn pierced his belly, and suddenly the air was filled with the heavenly scent.

"Abraham Verghese","As he lowered himself to the bed, she tried to push him away. “You can’t sleep with me. Why are you doing this, Digby?” He didn’t answer, pulling the sheet over his naked body and hers, snuggling against her. Her eyelids were heavy from her tears, from her ordeal, from relief, albeit temporary. He heard a mumbled, “I forbid you.” Then she was out. He looked at her sleeping form, her face as white as the pillowcase. Tired as he was, his thoughts were still racing, and sleep eluded him. An hour later, he was still awake, his arm numb under the weight of her head. He didn’t care if it fell off. He could no longer separate himself from her suffering. The disease that afflicted her was now his, too. He couldn’t linger on an estate that didn’t need him, knowing that the great love of his life was elsewhere.","The Covenant of Water",,,"page 749 location 11479-11486",,"March 9, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Abraham Verghese","And now that daughter is here, standing in the water that connects them all in time and space and always has. The water she first stepped into minutes ago is long gone and yet it is here, past and present and future inexorably coupled, like time made incarnate. This is the covenant of water: that they’re all linked inescapably by their acts of commission and omission, and no one stands alone.

"Tara Brach","One morning while Narayan was getting ready to leave for school, I was meditating in my bedroom. My mind was fairly quiet and still and rather than focusing attention, I was simply resting in awareness. As images, sounds and sensations arose and dissolved in the boundless space of mind, I perceived the beautiful freedom of not clinging to anything, and felt enormous tenderness for the world. The scent of Buddha nature was vibrant and immediate: I felt as wide-open as the sky, as wakeful as a radiant sun. There was nowhere to go; nothing was missing or outside of awareness. In the midst of this sitting, there was a loud knock on the door and Narayan barged into my room. Apologetic and breathless, he asked me for a ride to school—he had run as fast and hard as he could but still missed the bus. My open shining universe suddenly collapsed into the roles and duties of being a mom. I agreed, threw on some jeans and we headed out the door. As we crept slowly through Washington’s aggressive rush-hour traffic, I became increasingly edgy. When I asked him if he felt prepared for today’s science quiz he mumbled, “Not exactly.” Further questioning revealed that he had forgotten to take his lab notes home the prior day. I stopped myself from making my typical observations on how he organized his life, or from saying anything punitive. But inside, I could feel my gut tighten with irritation. When he made his habitual move for the radio, I muttered, “No way,” and angrily pushed his hand away. Rap was just too much. As I felt the grim set of my jaw and the tightness of my mind, I reminded myself that this too was another opportunity to practice mindfulness. But this reminder was only an abstraction. The concrete reality was I felt uptight and armored, a neurotic mother trapped in reactivity. The awareness I cherished and had so recently known as my true nature was a fragrance somewhere out there, distant and far away. It had nothing to do with the person making her way through the traffic","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 289 location 4310-4324",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","At the culminating moment of Gautama Buddha’s awakening, he faced the enormous force of doubt. He had spent the night under the bodhi tree, responding with mindfulness and compassion to all the various challenges of Mara, the god of greed, hatred and delusion. As night was beginning to fade, Gautama knew that his heart and mind were awake, but he was not yet fully free. Mara then issued his final and most difficult challenge: By what right did Siddhartha aspire to Buddhahood? In other words, “Who do you think you are?” This voice of Mara is the one that urges us to turn against ourselves, to give up the path, convincing us that we are going nowhere. In response to this challenge, Gautama reached down and touched the earth, calling on it to bear witness to his many lifetimes of compassion. In touching the earth, he was also touching the ground of wakeful presence—the heart of perfect wisdom from which all enlightened beings spring. He was calling on his true identity to dispel all the doubt that kept him from complete freedom. According to the legend, at the moment when he touched the ground, the earth trembled and the sky was filled with rumbling. Mara, seeing that he was facing not a man but the creative power of awareness itself, fearfully withdrew.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 290 location 4332-4341",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","Just as the Buddha touched the earth in response to Mara’s final challenge, when the voice of doubt afflicts us, we touch the ground by arriving, on the spot, in this moment. We touch the ground by directly connecting with the earth, the life of our bodies, our breath and our inner weather. We touch the ground by looking directly into the awareness that is the very source of our life. As we connect with what is right in front of us, we realize the true immensity of who we are.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 292 location 4350-4353",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","The Buddha taught that holding on to anything, including a sense of being the observer, obscures the full freedom of awareness","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 292 location 4360-4361",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","I shared with him the instructions my Tibetan meditation teacher, Tsokney Rinpoche, gives for recognizing our true nature: “Look and see . . . Let go and be free.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 293 location 4378-4379",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","I shared with him the instructions my Tibetan meditation teacher, Tsokney Rinpoche, gives for recognizing our true nature: “Look and see . . . Let go and be free.” Rinpoche illustrates this by first holding his hands up about a foot in front of his face, palms facing outward. Our attention, like our palms turned outward, is always focusing on the movie of life—our outer as well as our inner world. Turning his palms toward himself he demonstrates the act of looking directly into awareness— “Look and see.” Releasing our focus on thoughts and other objects of experience, we look directly at who is looking. Then, with, “Let go, be free,” Rinpoche’s hands drift gently down to rest in his lap. When we look into our awareness and see what is true, we relax, completely letting go into that reality.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 293 location 4378-4384",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","In a classic Zen story, the disciple Hui-K’e asks his master, Bodhidharma, “Please help me to quiet my mind.” Bodhidharma responds by saying, “Bring me your mind so that I can quiet it.” After a long moment of silence Hui-K’e says, “But I can’t find my mind!” “There,” Bodhidharma replies with a smile. “I have now quieted your mind.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 294 location 4389-4392",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","Like Hui-K’e, when we look within, there is no entity, no mind-substance, no self, no thing we can identify. There is just awareness—open empty awareness. We can’t locate any center, nor can we find an edge to our experience. Unless we anchor ourselves again in thoughts, or grasp after desired sensations or feelings, we have nowhere to stand, no firm ground. This can be disconcerting, scary, incredibly mysterious. While there may be a profusion of activity—sounds, sensations, images—there is no thing to hold on to, no self behind the curtain managing things. This seeing of no thing is what the Tibetan teachers call “the supreme seeing.”","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 294 location 4392-4397",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","But this emptiness, this “no-thingness,” is not empty of life. Rather, empty awareness is full with presence, alive with knowing. The very nature of awareness is cognizance, a continuous knowing of the stream of experience. In this moment that you are reading, sounds are heard, vibration is felt, form and color are seen. This knowing happens instantaneously, spontaneously. Like a sunlit sky, awareness is radiant in cognizance and boundless enough to contain all life.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 295 location 4397-4400",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","Sri Nisargadatta writes, “The real world is beyond our thoughts and ideas; we see it through the net of our desires divided into pleasure and pain, right and wrong, inner and outer. To see the universe as it is, you must step beyond the net. It is not hard to do so, for the net is full of holes.”","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 295 location 4402-4404",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","When thoughts arise, where do they come from, where do they go to? As you explore looking into the space between thoughts, through the holes in the net, you are looking into awareness itself. You might sit quietly and simply listen for a few moments. Notice how sounds arise and dissolve back into formless awareness. Can you notice the beginnings of sounds, the ends of sounds? The spaces between? It is all happening in awareness, known by awareness. To “Look and see . . . Let go and be free” is revolutionary and counterintuitive. Rather than trying to control or interpret our experience, we train to relax our grip. By wakefully letting go into what is right here, we are carried home into the mystery and beauty that is our deepest nature.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 295 location 4410-4415",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
"Tara Brach","Lama Gendun Rinpoche writes: Happiness cannot be found through great effort and will power, But is already there, in relaxation and letting-go. Don’t strain yourself, there is nothing to do . . . Only our search for happiness prevents us from seeing it . . . Don’t believe in the reality of good and bad experiences; They are like rainbows. Wanting to grasp the ungraspable, you exhaust yourself in vain. As soon as you relax this grasping, space is there —open, inviting, and comfortable. So, make use of it. All is yours already. Don’t search any further . . . Nothing to do. Nothing to force, Nothing to want, —and everything happens by itself.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 296 location 4415-4424",,"March 10, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",

"Tara Brach","In one of the Jataka tales, mythical teaching stories based on the Buddha’s previous lifetimes, the Buddha was a good merchant living in a small village in north India. One afternoon, while working in his shop, he glanced outside and saw a beautiful and luminous person walking across the town square. He was stunned. As he continued to watch, he felt his heart light up in celebration. Never in his life had he seen a human being so visibly radiating compassion. Never had he sensed the divine shining forth with such immanence. The merchant knew immediately that he wanted to serve this being and give his life to awakening such love in his own heart. With great care he prepared a tray of ripe fruits and tea to offer as nourishment. He stepped out into the sunlit day, moving mindfully and joyfully toward the luminous one who seemed to stand awaiting him. Suddenly, when the merchant was only halfway across the town square, the daylight suddenly turned to darkness. The ground quaked violently, and a gash in the earth appeared between him and the one he longed to serve. Lightning bolts ripped through the blackened skies, and he saw the glaring eyes and bloody mouths of horrifying demons. He was surrounded by the voices of Mara: “Go back! Turn around! It’s too dangerous . . . you won’t survive!” As crashing thunder shook the air the voices warned, “This way is not for you! Who do you think you are? Go back to your shop, to the life you know.” Terrified, the good merchant was about to turn around and flee for safety. But at that moment his heart swelled with a longing so great it could fill the entire universe. This desire for love and freedom was stronger than any voice of warning. With the image of the radiant being filling his mind, he took one step into the dark chaos of Mara. And then another and another. The demons disappeared, the brilliant light of day returned and the earth came together, healed and once again whole. The merchant, trembling with aliveness, overflowing with love and gratitude, found himself standing right in front of the luminous figure. The great being embraced him, saying, “Well done, bodhisattva, well done. Walk on through all the fears and pain in this life. Walk on, following your heart and trusting in the power of awareness. Walk on, one step at a time, and you will know a freedom and peace beyond all imagining.” As he heard these words, the good merchant felt his entire being fill with light. Looking around, he saw this same divine presence shining through the ground and trees, the singing birds and every blade of grass. He and the great being and every part of this living world belonged to boundless, radiant presence.","Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame",,,"page 301 location 4485-4504",,"March 11, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",

"9781250865052","Take the story of Matthew Dicks, today a world-champion storyteller and bestselling novelist. Years before he published his first book, Dicks worked in McDonald’s. And he hated it. ‘The days felt endless,’ Matt once told me. ‘It was the same routine over and over again. Taking orders, flipping burgers and handing out fries. There was no excitement, no spark, no challenge.’ And so Dicks decided to see if there was any joy to be had, not in the job’s outcome (his infuriatingly meagre pay cheque), but in the process instead. He landed on a classic tactic: upselling. ‘Some days I’d decide it was BBQ Sauce Day,’ he recalls. ‘So for the rest of the day, I’d add a mini sales pitch to each order I took. The customer would order a Big Mac and fries, and I’d ask them if they’d like any sauce with that. If they said no, I’d smile and say, “Well, I’d really recommend the BBQ sauce – there’s nothing that beats that.” Usually at this point, they were a little taken aback, and they’d say, “Ok then, I’ll take the sauce.” If they still didn’t bite, I’d say, “That’s ok, but you’re really missing out. My last customer was reluctant but when she tried the sauce she knew she’d made the right decision.”’ Dicks says that the effects of these little changes in his routine were unexpectedly significant. They were the kind of mini tasks that might, in his words: ‘just make the customer’s day a little better, and definitely made me feel more energised on days that felt like they were dragging’. And they worked. Dicks found himself looking forward to his shifts, eager to see how many people he could convince to try the BBQ sauce. The process was not inherently enjoyable. But Dicks had created a way to enjoy it. And in doing so, he had found the fun in an uninspiring situation.","Feel-good Productivity : How to Do More of What Matters to You",,,"page 27 location 399-413",,"April 12, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1717199295426","June 1, 2024 9:48 am",
