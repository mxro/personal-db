"Anthony De Mello","The fact is that you’re surrounded by God and you don’t see God, because you “know” about God. The final barrier to the vision of God is your God concept.

"Anthony De Mello","Causing pain to the self, causing suffering to the self would be self-defeating. It would be counterproductive. You’re never so full of yourself as when you’re in pain. You’re never so centered on yourself as when you’re depressed. You’re never so ready to forget yourself as when you are happy. Happiness releases you from self.","Awareness",,,"page 83 location 1272-1275",,"January 1, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1706942462881","February 3, 2024 5:41 pm",

"Anthony De Mello","Pleasant experiences make life delightful. Painful experiences lead to growth. Pleasant experiences make life delightful, but they don’t lead to growth in themselves. What leads to growth is painful experiences.

"Anthony De Mello","Do not suppress desire, because then you would become lifeless. You’d be without energy and that would be terrible.

"Anthony De Mello","One reason we don’t perceive people clearly is evident—our emotions get in the way, our conditioning, our likes and dislikes. We’ve got to grapple with that fact. But we’ve got to grapple with something much more fundamental—with our ideas, with our conclusions, with our concepts.

"Anthony De Mello","Let’s talk more about effortlessness in change. I thought of a nice image for that, a sailboat. When a sailboat has a mighty wind in its sail, it glides along so effortlessly that the boatman has nothing to do but steer. He makes no effort; he doesn’t push the boat. That’s an image of what happens when change comes about through awareness, through understanding.","Awareness",,,"page 126 location 1924-1927",,"January 3, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1706942462881","February 3, 2024 5:41 pm",
"Anthony De Mello","When you cut water, the water doesn’t get hurt; when you cut something solid, it breaks.

Or when you’re really conversing with someone whose company you enjoy in openness and intimacy without clinging? What kind of feelings do you have? Compare those feelings with the feelings you have when you win an argument, or when you win a race, or when you become popular, or when everybody’s applauding you. The latter feelings I call worldly feelings; the former feelings I call soul feelings. Lots of people gain the world and lose their soul. Lots of people live empty, soulless lives because they’re feeding themselves on popularity, appreciation, and praise, on “I’m O.K., you’re O.K.,” look at me, attend to me, support me, value me, on being the boss, on having power, on winning the race.","Awareness",,,"page 145 location 2221-2226",,"January 6, 2024","Kindle Import Timestamp 1706942462881","February 3, 2024 5:41 pm",
