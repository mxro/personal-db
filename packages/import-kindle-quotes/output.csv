"Frances A Yates","The fragment known as the Dialexeis, which is dated to about 400 B.C., contains a tiny section on memory, as follows: A great and beautiful invention is memory, always useful both for learning and for life. This is the first thing: if you pay attention (direct your mind), the judgment will better perceive the things going through it (the mind). Secondly, repeat again what you hear; for by often hearing and saying the same things, what you have learned comes complete into your memory. Thirdly, what you hear, place on what you know. For example, [Chrysippus] is to be remembered; we place it on [gold] and [horse]. Another example: we place [glow-worm] on [fire] and [shine]. So much for names.

"Frances A Yates","(1) The first of these is that he should assume some convenient similitudes of the things which he wishes to remember; these should not be too familiar, because we wonder more at unfamiliar things and the soul is more strongly and vehemently held by them; whence it is that we remember better things seen in childhood. It is necessary in this way to invent similitudes and images because simple and spiritual intentions slip easily from the soul unless they are as it were linked to some corporeal similitudes, because human cognition is stronger in regard to the sensibilia. Whence the memorative [power] is placed in the sensitive [part] of the soul. (2) Secondly it is necessary that a man should place in a considered order those [things] which he wishes to remember, so that from one remembered [point] progress can easily be made to the next. Whence the Philosopher says in the book De memoria: ‘some men can be seen to remember from places. The cause of which is that they pass rapidly from one [step] to the next.’ (3) Thirdly, it is necessary that a man should dwell with solicitude on, and cleave with affection to, the things which he wishes to remember; because what is strongly impressed on the soul slips less easily away from it. Whence Tullius says in his Rhetoric that ‘solicitude conserves complete figures of the simulachra’. (4) Fourthly, it is necessary that we should meditate frequently on what we wish to remember. Whence the Philosopher says in the book De memoria that ‘meditation preserves memory’ because, as he says ‘custom is like nature. Thence, those things which we often think about we easily remember, proceeding from one to another as though in a natural order.’ Let us consider with care Thomas Aquinas’s four precepts for memory.","The Art of Memory",,,"page 94 location 1427-1441",,"October 30, 2021 10:13 pm","Kindle Import Timestamp 1672205857016","December 28, 2022 4:37 pm",

The second is that he should adhere to them with affection. The third is that he should reduce them to unusual similitudes. The fourth is that he should repeat them with frequent meditation.","The Art of Memory",,,"page 105 location 1600-1605",,"October 30, 2021 10:37 pm","Kindle Import Timestamp 1672205857016","December 28, 2022 4:37 pm",

The number 34 might be Frank Sinatra (a person) crooning (an action) into a microphone (an object). Likewise, 13 might be David Beckham kicking a soccer ball.

Daniel says he has a unique synesthetic reaction like that for every number up to 10,000, and that experiencing numbers in this way allows him to do quick mental math without pencil or paper. To multiply two numbers, he sees each number’s shape floating in his mind’s eye. Intuitively, and without effort, he says, a third shape, the answer, forms in the negative space between them. “It’s like a crystallization. It’s like developing a photo,” Daniel told me. “Division is just the reverse of multiplication. I see the number and I pull it apart in my head. It’s like leaves falling from a tree.” Daniel believes his synesthetic shapes somehow implicitly encode important information about the properties of numbers.

"Dan Heath","In the Introduction, we debunked the common assumption that you need natural creative genius to cook up a great idea. You don’t. But, beyond that, it’s crucial to realize that creation, period, is unnecessary. Think of the ideas in this book that were spotted rather than created: Nordies. Jared. The mystery of Saturn’s rings. Pam Laffin, the smoking antiauthority. The nurse who ignored the heart monitor, listened with her stethoscope, and saved the baby’s life. If you’re a great spotter, you’ll always trump a great creator. Why? Because the world will always produce more great ideas than any single individual, even the most creative one.","Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die",,,"page 237 location 3626-3630",,"April 25, 2022 8:18 pm","Kindle Import Timestamp 1672205857016","December 28, 2022 4:37 pm",

"Daniel Mason","And day in and day out the philosophers spoke of whether men were good or evil, but they did nothing. At last Psammetichus, tired of such womanly lassitude, devised an experiment to answer their question once and for all. This time, he selected three newborn children of boatmen and gave them to a swineherd with the following instructions. One child was to be raised as normal and taught to do good, while the second was to be taught the reverse: namely, that one should murder and steal and lie and engage in all other sorts of filth that is shocking to the gods. The third child would be raised wild among the pigs. And I was told that when the children were three years old they were all brought to the palace, where one by one they were placed in a room with a kitten, a coin, and a piece of bread. As had been foreseen, the child raised in goodness stroked the little kitten, fed it the bread (even softening it with the moisture of his own mouth), and made gentle inquiries as to whom the coin belonged. Next, the child raised against the law was brought into the room. Immediately, he killed the kitten, pocketed the coin, and ate the bread. When he was asked as to the fate of the coin and bread, he said they were eaten by the kitten. Finally the last child, the wild one raised by pigs, was summoned. He ate the bread, tried to eat the coin, and played with the kitten. From this Psammetichus learned that the answer to whether man is good or evil is: inconclusive.","A Registry of My Passage upon the Earth",,,"page 72 location 1096-1107",,"July 3, 2022 9:27 pm","Kindle Import Timestamp 1672205857016","December 28, 2022 4:37 pm",
