"Nicholas A. Christakis","Complicating matters, over time certain behaviors that previously were learned may actually become genetic. This is known as the Baldwin effect, and it works as follows: In any given generation of a species, some animals might be born, by chance, with gene variants that make it easier for them to learn a particular behavior. For instance, some birds might learn a song more easily than others because they have brains more capable of producing the typical introductory note of the song. If this behavior is adaptive (for example, if the song helps the birds attract mates), then it confers a fitness advantage on them, and the genes that make it easy to learn the behavior get reinforced and expand in frequency as the population reproduces. The same thing continues to happen. In each generation, those animals fare best who are most easily able to learn the target behavior, because they innately manifest more and more of it. Having acquired the innate capacity to produce the initial note, some birds might now be born with other gene variants that make it easier for them to produce the motifs of the song. These too could become innate, across generations, in response to selection. Eventually, over time, the entire behavior—and not just its predicates—comes to be encoded in the genes.117 What was previously a nongenetic action has become a genetically encoded one.","Blueprint",,,"page 353 location 5408-5418",,"February 6, 2021 2:45 am","Kindle Import Timestamp 1632010442079","September 19, 2021 10:14 am",

"Alex Halberstadt","The campaigns Batu waged against the people living on the territory of modern-day Russia inflicted killing and suffering on a scale unknown until the twentieth century. It had taken the Mongols sixty years to conquer China; they subjugated all of Russia in three. Instead of occupying its cities, Batu simply immolated them, after putting everyone inside their walls to death. Beginning in 1237, he razed Riazan, Kolomna, Kostroma, Yaroslavl, Uglich, Kashin, Ksnyatin, Galich, Gorodets, Kozelsk, Rostov, Suzdal, Volokolamsk, Chernigov, Smolensk, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Yuriev-Polsky, Dmitrov, Torzhok and Tver—among the larger cities, only Vladimir and Pskov were left standing. His army cut down some 270,000 people in Moscow alone. The Mongols put to death every man, woman and child in the city of Vladimir and nearly depopulated the Dnieper region. In 1240, Batu reached Kiev. The most beautiful city in ancient Rus and its capital, Kiev was said to have exceeded western European cities in both size and splendor. It had been home to more than six hundred churches, and its noble families were related, by marriage or blood, to the monarchs of Byzantium, England and the Holy Roman Empire. After breaching Kiev’s walls and killing nearly everyone inside, Batu’s soldiers emptied the tombs as well, scattering the bones of the dead and smashing the skulls with their heels. Then they set fire to the city.","Young Heroes of the Soviet Union",,,"page 268 location 4107-4116",,"April 3, 2021 10:00 pm","Kindle Import Timestamp 1632010442079","September 19, 2021 10:14 am",

"Josh Waitzkin","When I was twenty-one years old and came back to America, I was more in love with the study of chess than ever. The game had become endlessly fascinating to me, and its implications stretched far beyond winning and losing—I was no longer primarily refining the skill of playing chess, but was discovering myself through chess. I saw the art as a movement closer and closer to an unattainable truth, as if I were traveling through a tunnel that continuously deepened and widened as I progressed. The more I knew about the game, the more I realized how much there was to know. I emerged from each good work session in slightly deeper awe of the mystery of chess, and with a building sense of humility. Increasingly, I felt more tender about my work than fierce.

"Derek Sivers","As a business owner, when you get screwed over by someone, you might be tempted to make a big grand policy that you think will prevent your ever getting screwed over again: One employee can’t focus and spends his time surfing the Web. Instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall so that nobody can go to unapproved sites ever again. It’s important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture. In the moment, you’re angry, focusing only on that one awful person who did you wrong. Your thinking is clouded. You start believing everyone is awful and the whole world is against you. This is a horrible time to make a new policy. When one customer wrongs you, remember the hundred thousand who did not. You’re lucky to own your own business. Life is good. You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Learn to shrug.

Today penicillin is effective at the first sign of genital sores, but in 1848, eight decades before its discovery, most women ill enough to end up at Blockley were deep into the debilitating and disfiguring tertiary stage of the disease: seizures, incontinence, blindness, dementia, and necrotic lesions that ate away the bones of jaw and face and skull. The collapsed profile characteristic of advanced cases was known as “saddle nose.” Blockley’s patients were likely also suffering the effects of earlier attempts to cure them. “One night with Venus, a lifetime with Mercury,” went the adage. Mercury—in the form of calomel ointment or pills—was used to burn away syphilitic sores and purge infection, but the intense excretion and salivation it caused led to kidney damage and eroded gums, and then there were the cognitive effects of mercury poisoning. The righteous uninfected saw these afflictions as appropriate punishment for promiscuity. Blockley’s syphilis ward was a gallery of misery. Its inmates had no idea what to make of the studious newcomer in their midst, and Elizabeth, at least initially, was at first equally innocent of the circumstances that might have led to their hospitalization. “Most of the women are unmarried, a large proportion having lived at service and been seduced by their masters,” she noted. “I found no instance of a married woman living with her husband entering.” She could hear them lurking outside her door; in response, she moved her desk to a position in line with the keyhole, in full view of the curious. “It was thought that my residence there might act as a check on these very disorderly inmates,” she wrote, but their impact on her was more profound.
