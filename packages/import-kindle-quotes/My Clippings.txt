“Chhodo” At the checkstand I say, “Here’s some burfi for you, no no madam, no cost for children.” I see him bite eager into the brown sweet flavored with clove and cardamom and cinnamon. He smiles a small smile to answer mine. Crushed clove and cardamom, Jagjit, to make your breath fragrant. Cardamom which I will scatter tonight on the wind for you. North wind carrying them to open your teacher’s unseeing. And also sweet pungent clove, lavang, spice of compassion. So your mother of a sudden looking up from the washboard, pushing tired hair from her face, “Jaggi beta, tell me what happened,” will hold you in her soapsud arms. And here is cinnamon, hollow dark bone that I tuck unseen in your turban just before you go. Cinnamon friend-maker, cinnamon dalchini warm-brown as skin, to find you someone who will take you by the hand, who will run with you and laugh with you and say See this is America, it’s not so bad. And for the others with the pebble-hard eyes, cinnamon destroyer of enemies to give you strength, strength which grows in your legs and arms and mostly mouth till one day you shout no loud enough to make them, shocked, stop. When we had passed the ceremony of purification, when we were ready to leave the island and meet our separate destinies, the Old One said, “Daughters it is time for me to give you your new names. For when you came to this island you left your old names behind, and have remained nameless since. “But let me ask you one last time. Are you certain you wish to become Mistresses? It is not too late to choose an easier life. “Are you ready to give up your young bodies, to take on age and ugliness and unending service? Ready never to step out of the places where you are set down, store or school or healing house? “Are you ready never to love any but the spices again?” Around me my sister-novices, their garments still wet from the seawater she had poured on them, stood silent, shivering a little. And it seemed to me the prettiest ones kept their eyes lowered longest. Ah, now I have learned how deep in the human heart vanity lies, vanity which is the other face of the fear of being unloved. But on that day I who was the Old One’s brightest pupil, quick to master every spell and chant, quick to speak with the spices, even the most dangerous, quick to arrogance and impatience as often I was, had thrown them a glance, half pity and half derision. I had looked the Old One boldly in the eye and said, “I am.” I who was not beautiful and thought therefore I had little to lose. The Old One’s stare stung me like the thorn-herb. But she said only “Very well.” And called us to approach her, each alone. Through sea mist the island cast its pearl light around us. In the sky rainbows

City of a million jewels turned at the last to ash. Though more than once I have been tempted. As when Jagjit comes to the store. In the inner room of the store, on the topmost shelf, sits a sealed jar filled with red fingers of light. One day I will open it and the chilies will flicker to the ground. And blaze. Lanka, fire-child, cleanser of evil. For when there is no other way. Jagjit comes to the store with his mother. Stands partly behind her, his fingers touching her dupatta although he is ten and a half already and tall as wild bamboo. “Oi Jaggi don’t hang on me like a girl, go get me a packet of sabu papads.” Jagjit with his thin, frightened wrists who has trouble in school because he knows only Punjabi still. Jagjit whom the teacher has put in the last row next to the drooling boy with milk-blue eyes. Jagjit who has learned his first English word. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. I walk to the back where he stares in confusion at the shelves of papads, the packets stamped with hieroglyphs of Hindi and English. I hand him the sabu papads. I tell him “They’re the bumpy white ones, see. Next time you’ll know.” Shy-eyed Jagjit in your green turban that the kids at school make fun of, do you know your name means world-conqueror? But already his mother is shouting “What’s taking you so long Jaggi, can’t find the papads, are you blind, the hairs on my head will go white waiting waiting by the time you get back.” In the playground they try to pull it off his head, green turban the color of a parrot’s breast. They dangle the cloth from their fingertips and laugh at his long, uncut hair. And push him down. Asshole, his second English word. And his knees bleeding from the gravel. Jagjit who bites down on his lip so the cry will not out. Who picks up his muddy turban and ties it on slowly and goes inside. “Jaggi how come you’re always dirtying your school clothes, here is a button gone and look at this big tear on your shirt, you badmash, you think I’m made of money.” At night he lies with his eyes open, staring

Near sunset, threading their way through a patch of denser woods, they came suddenly on a little glade of astonishing beauty. A waterfall foamed down over a bed of black rocks that glistened like obsidian, a cascade of lace alive with light. The grass that bordered the streambed was backlit by the sun in a translucent gold glow. The surrounding trees, tall, dark green, and shady, set it like a gem.

This extended the story through to the no less remarkable tale of Khair un-Nissa’s daughter, Kitty Kirkpatrick. She had initially been brought up as Sahib Begum, a Muslim noblewoman in Hyderabad, before being shipped off to England at four years old, baptised on her arrival in London and thenceforth completely cut off from her maternal relations. Instead she had been absorbed into the upper echelons of Victorian literary society, where she had fascinated her cousins’ tutor, the young Thomas Carlyle, and formed the basis for the heroine Blumine, ‘a many tinted radiant Aurora … the fairest of Oriental light-bringers’, in Carlyle’s novel Sartor Resartus.

Stuart was not just an admirer of the Indian religions, he was also an enthusiastic devotee of Hindu women and their dress sense. In the early years of the nineteenth century he wrote a series of improbable articles in the Calcutta Telegraph in which he tried to persuade the European women of the city to adopt the sari, on the grounds that it was so much more attractive than contemporary European fashions, and warning that otherwise Englishwomen had no hope of competing with the beauty of the women of India: The majority of Hindoo women are comparatively small, yet there is much voluptuousness of appearance:—a fulness that delights the eye; a firmness that enchants the sense; a sleekness and purity of skin; an expression of countenance, a grace, and a modesty of demeanour, that renders them universally attractive … The new-mown hay is not sweeter than their breath … I have seen ladies of the Gentoo cast, so exquisitely formed, with limbs so divinely turned, and such expression in their eyes, that you must acknowledge them not inferior to the most celebrated beauties of Europe. For my own part, I already begin to think the dazzling brightness of a copper coloured face, infinitely preferable to the pallid and sickly hue of the European fair.z

Later in life he would come to regard the East India Company as an untrustworthy and aggressive force in Indian politics. But in the early 1790s he still subscribed to the conventional English view which tended to see Indian rulers as ‘effeminate’ and ‘luxurious’ tyrants, whose ‘unorganised despotism’ sapped their countries of strength and the possibility of progress. This was perceived as a direct contrast to the Company, whose introduction of Western ways to India, protected by an army of ‘undaunted spirit and irresistible ardour’, was believed by most of the British in India to bring unambiguous blessings to the subcontinent.

It is said that in contrast to many of the English who are often proud, haughty and snobbish, Kirkpatrick was a very cordial and friendly person. Anyone who had spent a little time with him would be won over by his pleasant manners. In the very first meeting, he would make the other person feel he had known him for years, and take him for an old friend and acquaintance. He was completely fluent in the language and idiom of these parts, and followed many of the customs of the Deccan. Indeed he had spent so much time in the company of the women of Hyderabad that he was very familiar with the style and behaviour of the city and adopted it as his own. Thanks partly to these women he was always very cheerful.

As well as being a popular excuse for a holiday, the festival played an important political role, by allowing the Nizams to reach out across the sectarian divide in the Hyderabadi aristocracy, a divide that split the nobles of the kingdom straight down the middle. The old Qutb Shahi élite, as well as the other old Deccani families from towns such as Aurangabad and Bidar, had been almost entirely Shi’a. Their numbers had been augmented by the large numbers of new Shi’a Persian immigrants welcomed to Hyderabad by a succession of Shi’a Ministers including Aristu Jah and Mir Alam.10 The Nizams were however themselves solidly Sunni, as were the nobles of the élite Paigah clan and most of the Mughal soldiers and courtiers who had emigrated from Delhi to join them in the Deccan.

Knolling is a system of placing objects, usually tools, at right angles to one another on a work surface. It originated in Frank Gehry’s furniture workshop in the late 1980s and was popularized by the artist Tom Sachs. Mise en place, which is French for “putting in its place,” is a similar practice used in professional kitchens to set up for a shift by neatly laying out all ingredients and tools that will be needed. Both knolling and mise en place are strategies that enable smooth workflow, allowing workers to see and use materials in a fluid way.

The shape of our built environment is defined by choices that are hundreds, if not thousands, of years old. As these choices solidified our buildings and roads into a rigid, angular grid, they took us further and further from the curving, undulating landscape within which we evolved. Perhaps in the process, they also took us further from essential aspects of our own nature: playfulness, creativity, sensuality, joy.

A belief in magic may be irrational, but according to Matthew Hutson, author of The Seven Laws of Magical Thinking: How Irrational Beliefs Keep Us Happy, Healthy, and Sane, magic can be valuable because it imbues life with a deeper sense of meaning. “Magic fights the cold sense that we’re alone in the universe, that we’re just a collection of atoms that happens to have evolved into an organism that sits and wonders about things,” says Hutson. “It weaves a story where there’s an ultimate purpose, and the universe is looking out for us, or at least cares about what we care about.”

If we view the future as a blank, uncertain space, then it’s hard to trust that joy will return once it has gone. Each downswing of joy feels like a regression, each nadir like stagnation. But if instead we can rely on the repetition of certain delights at regular intervals, then the wavelike quality of joy becomes more present in our lives. Cycles create a symmetry between past and future that reminds us joy will come back again.

As long as your life is static, you will be extremely limited in your ability to rewrite the personal mental model that governs your unconscious behavior. However, when our lives are not static, it is as if the code that makes up our personalities becomes malleable. During these periods, our internal models of self will almost certainly change, whether we choose to change them, they serendipitously change, or our environment/social group influences them. These periods of flux—moments in which your internal model can be edited—can occur during: Major life transitions: Many people experience a personality reinvention between high school and college, when moving to a new city for a new job, when getting out of prison, etc. Major social transitions: If you are transitioning social groups (especially if your schedule also significantly changes), it is possible to enter a period of flux—even if you are not in a novel environment. Moments experiencing abnormally high levels of oxytocin release: This happens when one is falling in love, dating a new person, etc. Hitting rock bottom: This may involve entering prison, nearing the end of an addiction spiral, nearly dying, losing everything in a divorce, etc. Getting high: Altered states of consciousness achieved through meditation or drugs, particularly certain hallucinogens, can lead an individual into a state in which one can rewrite their self-model. Unfortunately, while these altered states of consciousness allow us to rewrite who we are and what we believe, they enable us to make these changes during a time in which our cognition is impaired. New beliefs and personalities born from such states may be inherently defective when contrasted with those born of sound minds. (Do you really want to make one of the most important decisions in your life in a cognitively impaired state?) Pragmatist Foundation Workshops/Trips: One of the Pragmatist Foundation’s goals is studying how to induce these states. However, this research requires individuals who are willing to work with the foundation over time. If you are interested, please reach out so we can include you in studies. It is easy to read the above list and through reflecting on your own life realize that your personality did change some during periods like those described, and you had no idea just how susceptible your personality was to being rewritten during such periods.
