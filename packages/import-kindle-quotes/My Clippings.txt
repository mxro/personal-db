The subtleties of your humor and the nuances of your points have a harder time coming through. To compensate, you have to project more energy. Doing so feels unnatural if you’re sitting alone in your cubicle, but your onscreen audience needs every extra bit of energy they can get from you to keep their attention from sliding away.

To discuss politics with anyone is usually a fruitless experience; everyone states their case ill-temperedly, everyone vociferously disagrees, and, at the end, everyone believes exactly what they believed at the beginning.

Enthusiasm matters. At the moment you open your mouth, you control how much energy you will give to your audience. Everything else can go wrong, but I always choose to be enthusiastic so no one can ever say I wasn’t trying hard. The more I seem to care, the more likely people in the audience will care as well. One factor hinted at by the Dr. Fox experiment is that giving significant energy will always help you. By being enthusiastic and caring deeply about what you say, you may provide more value than a low-energy, dispassionate speaker who knows 10 times more than you do. You are more likely to keep the audience’s attention, which makes everything else possible.

A possible path to supporting this individual and building trust could be as follows: Ask questions about their current state, and listen truthfully and with your whole self.

And, as in the long nights of my Youth, when I could find no sleep, I lie here . . . and think of Numbers. For Numbers are the bridge between the World of Perfection and this fallen, foolish vale of tears. They exist both in the purity of abstraction, and in the concrete, solid, sinful world. They exist in the ten fingers of my twitching, clutching hands, in the spidery numeric scrawls in Schäffer’s books of accounts, they exist in that vision of perfection in this fallen world, the Cathedral, in its circles, in its triangles, in the parabolae of its curls and curves, a beauteous image of the Godhead as a finite, geometrical and comprehensible idea. And they exist also in pure conception, in the flights of numerical beauty that my mind conceives. Can one set a limit on numbers? Can one imagine where the line could be drawn and say . . . after this count, one may reckon no further? No. They have no beginning and have no end. Numbers stretch out, beyond our human limits, beyond our comprehension, to a boundless Infinity. This physical world, my body, my life, will come to an end, but numbers count onwards for ever, towards the greatest of all reckonings that can never, ever be reached.

Enough should be a human right, a floor below which no one can fall; also a ceiling above which no one can rise. Enough is a good as a feast— or better.

I’m in a nitty’s house in Folkestone with Stranger and we are sitting in the living room. The floor is covered in broken toys. There’s literally nowhere to step without treading on one. It looks like Father Christmas crashed here a year ago and abandoned the mission, I say to Stranger and he starts bussin up. The sell is one woman called Debbie. She comes into the living room holding some p’s and says let me get three light and two dark. She’s not yet finished by the habit. She still has this big yard, which isn’t ghetto or anything, and she obviously buys her yout loads of toys. But she’s on her way. Blonde hair, little black dress with a wrinkled cleavage pushed up in it and bare gold Argos jewellery hanging between her breasts. She’s wearing black thigh-length stockings and as she counts out the p’s, one of them rolls down to her calf and I can see blue veins running under the pale skin. She says something about how she’s gonna get a jacuzzi built in the garden. Before we leave, a little girl walks into the room, picks her way through the toys and goes over to a chest which she opens, revealing a pillow and some blankets, almost like a little bed. She picks up one of the broken toys, a Buzz Lightyear figure with his wings missing, smiles at us and climbs into the chest before closing the lid on herself.

The Riders knew humans well, but even they weren’t sure of the deadness in Øvn Nilsndot’s face. And Greenstalk knew humans well enough to see that there was no answer that would comfort Ravna.

Shechem had about five hundred inhabitants, not including the Egyptian garrison of some twenty men, whose commander, a very young officer from the region of the Delta, had been assigned here for the sole purpose of collecting an annual tax that was exacted directly from Hemor the city prince, but indirectly from the great merchants of the Lower City and took the form of several ring-shaped bars of gold that then had to be sent on to the city of Amun—and their failure to appear would have meant great personal unpleasantness for young Wêser-ke-Bastet, that being the name of the commander.

Something imminently awaited, precisely because it is so near, is a far fiercer and more direct test of our patience than something far off, making of it an impatience that strains nerves and muscles, turning us into invalids literally uncertain of what to do with our arms and legs, whereas with long-term waiting we retain our calm, since it does not merely allow, but indeed forces us to think other thoughts, do other deeds, for we must live. All of which gives rise to the strange statement that with whatever degree of yearning we may wait, it is not harder, but easier to do, the farther ahead in time what we await may lie.

In her fifth month, Laban insisted Rachel be taken to Haran, to a seer and priest of Sin’s temple, E-hulhul, so that he might foretell both her and her child’s future through augury. In the presence of others, Jacob held to his principles and declined to participate, but ultimately he was no less feverish than his kin to know the results and always the first to demand nothing be left undone.

Yes, the verdict, the judgment spoken by the oil—it was a murky and ambiguous matter; in possessing it, one was not much wiser than before, for it was both consolation and threat in one—but surely that was how the future had to sound if it could speak, and at least they had heard some sound from it, if only a buzzing, words spoken through lips shut tight.

There was once a beloved king whose castle was on a high hill, overlooking his shire. He was so popular that the nearby townspeople sent him gifts daily, and his birthday celebration was enjoyed throughout the kingdom. The people loved him for his renowned wisdom and fair judgments.   One day, tragedy struck the town. The water supply was polluted, and every man, woman, and child went insane. Only the king, who had a private spring, was spared.   Soon after the tragedy, the mad townspeople began speaking of how the king was acting “strangely” and how his judgments were poor and his wisdom a sham. Many even went so far as to say that the king had gone crazy. His popularity soon vanished. No longer did the people bring him gifts or celebrate his birthday.   The lonely king, high on the hill, had no company at all. One day he decided to leave the hill and pay a visit to the town. It was a warm day, and so he drank from the village fountain.   That night there was a great celebration. The people all rejoiced, for their beloved king had “regained his sanity.”

Alexander the Great, marching with his armies through the desert, came upon two thick ropes tied in the massive, convoluted Gordian knot. No one had been able to untie it until the challenge was given to Alexander. Without a moment's hesitation he drew his sword and in one powerful blow he cut the knot in two. He was a warrior!    “That is how you must learn to attack the knots of your mind--with the sword of meditation. Until one day you transcend your need for any weapon at all.”

Then I knew that awareness is how the human being experiences the light of consciousness. I learned the meaning of attention--it is the intentional channeling of awareness. I felt my body again, as a hollow vessel. I looked at my legs; they filled with warm, radiant light, disappearing into brightness. I looked at my arms, with the same result. I focused attention on every part of the body, until I became wholly light once again. Finally, I realized the process of real meditation to expand awareness, to direct attention, to ultimately surrender to the Light of Consciousness.

You must learn to enjoy the entire process--the hunger beforehand, the careful preparation, setting an attractive table, chewing, breathing, smelling, tasting, swallowing, and the feeling of lightness and energy after the meal. Finally, you can enjoy the full and easy elimination of the food after it's digested. When you pay attention to all these elements, you'll begin to appreciate simple meals; you won't need as much food.
