Every twenty-four-hour day is a tremendous gift to us. So we all should learn to live in a way that makes joy and happiness possible. We can do this. I begin my day by making an offering of incense while following my breath. I think to myself that this day is a day to live fully, and I make the vow to live each moment of it in a way that is beautiful, solid, and free. This only takes me three or four minutes, but it gives me a great deal of pleasure. You can do the same thing when you wake up. Breathe in and tell yourself that a new day has been offered to you, and you have to be here to live

The way to maintain your presence in the here and now is through mindfulness of the breath. There is no need to manipulate the breath. Breath is a natural thing, like air, like light; we should leave it as it is and not interfere with it. What we are doing is simply lighting up the lamp of awareness to illuminate our breathing. We generate the energy of mindfulness to illuminate everything that is happening in the present moment.

Do not fight against pain; do not fight against irritation or jealousy. Embrace them with great tenderness, as though you were embracing a little baby. Your anger is yourself, and you should not be violent toward it. The same thing goes for all of your emotions.

It’s like looking at a flower: letting it be as it is, mindful of the fact that it is there, a kind of miracle. See the flower as it is. See the breath as it is. We let the flower be as it is, and we should not do violence to our breath either.

If you feel irritation or depression or despair, recognize their presence and practice this mantra: “Dear one, I am here for you.” You should talk to your depression or your anger just as you would to a child. You embrace it tenderly with the energy of mindfulness and say, “Dear one, I know you are there, and I am going to take care of you,” just as you would with your crying baby. There is no discrimination or dualism here, because compassion and love are you, but anger is too.

Mindful breathing is a kind of bridge that brings the body and the mind together. If through mindfulness of the breath you generate harmony, depth, and calm, these will penetrate into your body and mind. In fact, whatever happens in the mind affects the body, and vice versa. If you generate peacefulness in your breathing, that peacefulness permeates your body and your state of mind. If you have practiced meditation, you have already discovered this. If you have been able to embrace your in-breath and your out-breath with tenderness, you know that they in turn embrace your body and your mind. Peace is contagious.

When you touch your heart with your mindfulness, you see that you have not been very friendly with it. You have eaten and drunk in ways that put great stress on it. You have not done everything you could to keep it in good health, even though it is one of the basic conditions of your well-being.

The Buddha taught us to meditate on the body. He suggested that we lie on the ground and begin to breathe. Begin with breathing mindfully, while recognizing each part of your body. You can start with your brain. Then you turn your attention to your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your tongue, touching them with mindful awareness and smiling as you touch each one. You can send energy, tenderness, and gratitude to the various parts of your body. “My heart,” you say, “I know that you are there for me, and I want to be there for you, too.” In this way, you will stop drinking alcohol and you will stop smoking, because they are harmful to your heart. With mindfulness, these things will appear to you clearly. What is love? Love is treating your heart with a great deal of tenderness, with understanding, love, and compassion. If you cannot treat your own heart this way, how can you treat your partner with understanding and love? My heart, I am here for you. My eyes, I am here for you. You embrace your body with a great deal of tenderness. You know that your body needs you. You should be there for it and generate the energy of mindfulness to bring it harmony, peace, and relaxation.

We’ve made all kinds of technological advances. Has that raised the quality of our living by one inch? Want to know my opinion? No, not one inch. Oh, we have more comfort. More speed. Pleasures, entertainment—that’s right. More erudition. Greater technological advances. What I’m saying is, has there been any improvement on ending that loneliness and emptiness and heartache? Any improvement on eliminating that greed and hatred and conflict? Less fighting? Less cruelty? If you want my opinion, I think it’s worse.

A monk was walking in the monastery grounds one day when he heard a bird sing.  He listened, spellbound. It seemed to him that never before had he heard, but really heard, the song of a bird.  When the singing stopped he returned to the monastery and discovered, to his dismay, that he was a stranger to his fellow monks, and they to him.  It was only gradually that they and he discovered that he was returning after centuries.  Because his listening was total, time had stopped and he had slipped into eternity.  Prayer is made perfect when the timeless is discovered.  The timeless is discovered through clarity of perception.  Perception is made clear when it is disengaged from preconceptions and from all consideration of personal loss or gain.  ‘Then the miraculous is seen and the heart is filled with wonder.

I’m reminded of that powerful story of the fisherman who goes out early in the morning to fish, and it’s too—whatever, I don’t understand these things—but apparently it’s too dark or something, and his foot hits upon something that seems like a sack. So he picks it up, probably washed ashore from some shipwreck or whatever. And he opens it and he can feel pebbles inside. So he takes these pebbles and he entertains himself until dawn, flinging those pebbles far out into the sea to see if he can judge from the “plop” how far he sent the pebble. When day begins to dawn, he looks into the sack and he finds three precious stones there. God, the sack was filled with precious stones and he hadn’t known it! Too late. Not too late—three stones left. Not too late.

The need to win drains us of power. If we don’t need to win, we have so much more energy. So, no one joins in the human enterprise of human dreams and visions and goals so marvelously and so creatively as the person who is unattached. Unfortunately, we’ve come to associate nonattachment with not caring, with not enjoying, with asceticism. No, I’m not talking about that at all.

There’s a Japanese master, a fellow called Bokoju. See, every time I think of his name, I imagine a plump, rotund kind of a guy, happy-go-lucky soul, Bokoju. It was said of Bojoku that every morning when he woke up, he’d give a great big belly laugh that resounded through the 250 cells of the monastery. Everyone could hear him. Everybody woke up with that laughter, like the alarm clock, see? Great big belly laugh. And he’d go on for about three or four minutes. And the last thing he did at night before he went to bed was, again, to let out a great big belly laugh, and then he’d curl up on his mat and go to sleep. And the disciples were very curious to know what it was that made the master laugh. And they tried their very best to get him to tell them. But he wouldn’t. And he died without telling them. That’s the end of the story.

There’s another nice story about this, about a camel trader, who’s walking across the Sahara Desert. The party pitches a tent for the night. And the slaves drive pegs into the ground and tie the camels to the pegs. Then they come in to say to the master, “There are only nineteen pegs and we’ve got twenty camels. How do we tie the twentieth camel?” And the master said, “These camels are stupid animals. Just go through the motions of tying the camel and he’ll stay put all night,” which is what they did, and the camel stood there, convincing everybody. And next morning when they lifted the tent and continued on their journey, the slaves came to complain that all the camels were following except this one. This one refused to budge. And the master said, “You forgot to untie him.” They said, “Oh, yes,” so they went through the motions of untying him.

That is an image of the human condition. We’re scared about things that are not. We’re tied to things that don’t exist. They’re illusions. They’re falsehoods. They’re beliefs; they’re not realities. The agonies we go through over things that we have—we have convinced ourselves that our happiness depends upon them, but it doesn’t. We don’t want to see it.

Spirituality means no longer being at the mercy of an event, or a person, or anything else. I didn’t say not to love people. I said, You’re not at their mercy anymore. You’re no longer at the mercy of an event, or of a person, or of anything else. In other words, no matter what happens, you no longer upset yourself.

It’s very hard to define maturity, but I’ve come up with a fairly workable definition: Maturity is when you no longer blame anyone. You don’t blame others, you don’t blame yourself. You see what’s wrong, and you set about remedying it. That’s one pretty good sign of maturity.

I think of the lovely story of the pious old man who said one day to God, “God, look how faithfully I’ve served you all my life, right?” Of course, he heard no answer. “Right,” said he to himself. “Now, I’ve never asked you for anything, right?” “Right,” said he, talking on behalf of God, of course. And he said, “Now, I’m going to ask you for just one favor and you can’t say no to me. All my life I’ve served you, I’ve observed the law, I’ve kept the rites. I’ve done good to people, I’ve observed your commandments. Just do me this one favor: Let me win the lottery, and then I can retire in peace and security.” So he was convinced that God would grant him his desire, and he waited and waited and waited. And he kept on praying every night. And after six months, nothing had happened. And then one night, in sheer frustration, he yelled: “God, give me a break. Let me win the lottery.” And imagine the fright he got when he heard a voice reply, “Give me a break yourself. Buy a ticket.”

I’m going to tell you one of my favorite stories. You know, sometimes a story says more than a whole day’s lecture because it speaks to the depths within us, and this one certainly speaks to mine. This is a story of a guy who is moving out of his village in India, and he sees what we in India call a sannyasi. The sannyasi is the wandering mendicant. This is the person who, having attained enlightenment, understands that the whole world is his home and the sky is his roof, and God is his father and will look after him, so he moves from place to place the way you and I would move from one room of our home to another. Here was this wandering sannyasi, and the villager, when he meets him, says, “I cannot believe this.” And the sannyasi says, “What is it you cannot believe?” And the villager says, “I had a dream about you last night. I dreamt that the Lord Vishnu said to me, ‘Tomorrow morning, you will leave the village around 11 o’clock, and you’ll run into this wandering sannyasi.’ And here, I’ve met you.” “What else did the Lord Vishnu say to you?” asks the sannyasi. And the man replies, “He said to me, ‘If the man gives you a precious stone he has, you will be the richest man in the whole world.’ Would you give me the stone?” So the sannyasi says, “Wait a minute.” He rummages in his little knapsack that he had. He asks, “Would this be the stone you’re talking about?” And the man couldn’t believe his eyes because it was a diamond—the largest diamond in the world. He holds the diamond in his hands and he asks, “Could I have this?” And the sannyasi says, “Of course, you could take it. I found it in a forest. You’re welcome to it.” And he goes on, and sits under a tree on the outskirts of the village. The man grasps this diamond, and how great is his joy.

So, the guy has the diamond. And then instead of going home, he sits under a tree, and all day he sits, immersed in thought. And toward evening, he goes to the tree where the sannyasi is sitting, gives him back the diamond, and says, “Could you do me a favor?” “What?” says the sannyasi. “Could you give me the riches that make it possible for you to give this thing away so easily?”

In love means: “I want you for me.” In love, I am in love, means “I’m possessive of you.” To be in love with you means “I want you for me; I’m not going to be happy without you; I emotionally depend on you; I can’t be happy without you.” That’s a drug. That’s a disease. Your culture and mine tells us that it’s the supreme virtue. That’s garbage, but who dares to say this? You’re blind. You’re full of yourself when you’re in love. Ever thought of that? You don’t see the other person; you’ve projected a hopeful image onto that person and that’s what you’re loving.

At last you can enjoy other people because you don’t need them. There’s no tension anymore. Do you know what it means to be with people and to have no tension? Because you don’t give a damn whether they like you or not, don’t care what they think of you. Do you know what that means? Freedom. Joy. They can think what they want, they can say what they want. That’s all right. You’re not affected.

Dr. Rune Orqvist appeared in Fort Cochin in 1910 AD, washing ashore like Ask and Embla. Like those first humans of Norse mythology, Rune quickly found his legs, and they carried him to food, shelter, drink, women, and raucous company. With his giant girth and his booming baritone, the first impression of the newly arrived blond, bearded foreigner was of an oracle, the sort of man who in apostolic robes, carrying a staff, could have stepped off a dhow alongside that other apostle, Saint Thomas. His arrival is clouded in almost as much myth as that of Saint Thomas. What is known is that South India was the last stop on a journey that began in Stockholm. According to the good doctor, one night, full of akvavit and “singing to myself on Stora Nygatan, I was abducted. When I woke up I was a ship’s physician on a vessel bound for Cape Town!” That occupation took him to all the major ports of the Orient and Africa.

Just as the ocean manifests as a wave or surf, but neither wave nor surf is the ocean, so also the Creator—God or Brahma—generates an impression of a universe that takes the form of a Swedish doctor, or a blind leper. Rune is real. The leper is real. The fishing net is real. Yet it is all maya, their separateness an illusion. All is one. The universe is nothing but a speck of foam on a limitless ocean that is the Creator. He feels euphoric and unburdened—the peace of God, which passeth all understanding.

The misty veil above him parts to reveal stars, the sky so low he feels he can extend a hand and touch the robe of God. He’s at peace. The chest pains that trouble him he is quite sure are angina, but he accepts this with equanimity. He’s living his faith, his amalgam of Christianity and Hindu philosophy. Medicine is his true priesthood, a ministry of healing the body and the soul of his flock. He will go on as long as he’s able.
