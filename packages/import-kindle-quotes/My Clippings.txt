Nonetheless, our ability to be charitable to members of our social groups provides us with something very profound: we can see ourselves as all being part of the same group, which means that, in the extreme, we can see that we are all human beings. We can efface the tribalism of small groups and find a kindness for large groups.

In his essay “The Culture of Liberty,” Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa notes that people who live in the same place, speak the same language, and practice the same religion obviously have much in common. But he points out that these collective traits do not fully define each individual. Seeing people only as members of groups is, he says, “inherently reductionist and dehumanizing, a collectivist and ideological abstraction of all that is original and creative in the human being, of all that has not been imposed by inheritance, geography, or social pressure.” Real, personal identity, he argues, “springs from the capacity of human beings to resist these influences and counter them with free acts of their own invention.”5

Complicating matters, over time certain behaviors that previously were learned may actually become genetic. This is known as the Baldwin effect, and it works as follows: In any given generation of a species, some animals might be born, by chance, with gene variants that make it easier for them to learn a particular behavior. For instance, some birds might learn a song more easily than others because they have brains more capable of producing the typical introductory note of the song. If this behavior is adaptive (for example, if the song helps the birds attract mates), then it confers a fitness advantage on them, and the genes that make it easy to learn the behavior get reinforced and expand in frequency as the population reproduces. The same thing continues to happen. In each generation, those animals fare best who are most easily able to learn the target behavior, because they innately manifest more and more of it. Having acquired the innate capacity to produce the initial note, some birds might now be born with other gene variants that make it easier for them to produce the motifs of the song. These too could become innate, across generations, in response to selection. Eventually, over time, the entire behavior—and not just its predicates—comes to be encoded in the genes.117 What was previously a nongenetic action has become a genetically encoded one.

The campaigns Batu waged against the people living on the territory of modern-day Russia inflicted killing and suffering on a scale unknown until the twentieth century. It had taken the Mongols sixty years to conquer China; they subjugated all of Russia in three. Instead of occupying its cities, Batu simply immolated them, after putting everyone inside their walls to death. Beginning in 1237, he razed Riazan, Kolomna, Kostroma, Yaroslavl, Uglich, Kashin, Ksnyatin, Galich, Gorodets, Kozelsk, Rostov, Suzdal, Volokolamsk, Chernigov, Smolensk, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Yuriev-Polsky, Dmitrov, Torzhok and Tver—among the larger cities, only Vladimir and Pskov were left standing. His army cut down some 270,000 people in Moscow alone. The Mongols put to death every man, woman and child in the city of Vladimir and nearly depopulated the Dnieper region. In 1240, Batu reached Kiev. The most beautiful city in ancient Rus and its capital, Kiev was said to have exceeded western European cities in both size and splendor. It had been home to more than six hundred churches, and its noble families were related, by marriage or blood, to the monarchs of Byzantium, England and the Holy Roman Empire. After breaching Kiev’s walls and killing nearly everyone inside, Batu’s soldiers emptied the tombs as well, scattering the bones of the dead and smashing the skulls with their heels. Then they set fire to the city.

When I was twenty-one years old and came back to America, I was more in love with the study of chess than ever. The game had become endlessly fascinating to me, and its implications stretched far beyond winning and losing—I was no longer primarily refining the skill of playing chess, but was discovering myself through chess. I saw the art as a movement closer and closer to an unattainable truth, as if I were traveling through a tunnel that continuously deepened and widened as I progressed. The more I knew about the game, the more I realized how much there was to know. I emerged from each good work session in slightly deeper awe of the mystery of chess, and with a building sense of humility. Increasingly, I felt more tender about my work than fierce. Art was truly becoming for art’s sake.

For a glimmer of this experience, hold your palms in front of you, forefingers a few inches apart, shoulders relaxed. Now breathe in while gently expanding your fingers, putting your mind on your middle fingers, forefingers, and thumbs. Your breath and mind should both softly shoot to the very tips of your fingers. This inhalation is slow, gently pulling oxygen into your dan tien (a spot believed to be the energetic center—located two and a half inches below the navel) and then moving that energy from your dan tien to your fingers. Once your inhalation is complete, gently exhale. Release your fingers, let your mind fall asleep, relax your hip joints, let everything sag into soft, quiet awareness. Once exhalation is complete, you reenergize. Try that exercise for a few minutes and see how you feel.

As a business owner, when you get screwed over by someone, you might be tempted to make a big grand policy that you think will prevent your ever getting screwed over again: One employee can’t focus and spends his time surfing the Web. Instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall so that nobody can go to unapproved sites ever again. It’s important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture. In the moment, you’re angry, focusing only on that one awful person who did you wrong. Your thinking is clouded. You start believing everyone is awful and the whole world is against you. This is a horrible time to make a new policy. When one customer wrongs you, remember the hundred thousand who did not. You’re lucky to own your own business. Life is good. You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Learn to shrug. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.

Adapted from the Latin verb exerceo (to work, train, or practice), the English word “exercise” was first used in the Middle Ages to connote arduous labor like plowing a field.

According to legend, the ancient Greek wrestler Milo of Croton developed his physique by lifting a calf over his head every day until it grew into a full-sized cow. The story seems about as likely as the legend of his death (Milo was supposedly torn apart by wolves after he unintentionally trapped himself in a tree that he was trying to rip apart with his bare hands).

Some of us imbue probability with emotion. It becomes luck: chance that has suddenly acquired a valence, positive or negative, fortuitous or unfortunate. Good or bad luck. A lucky or unlucky break. Some of us invest luck with meaning, direction, and intent. It becomes fate, karma, kismet—chance with an agenda. It was meant to be. Some even go a step further: predestination. It was always meant to be, and any sense of control or free will we may think we have is pure illusion.

“The good thing about poker is there’s enough luck that you never have to admit it’s your fault you lost.”) Attention is a powerful mitigator to overconfidence: it forces you to constantly reevaluate your knowledge and your game plan, lest you become too tied to a certain course of action. And if you lose? Well, it allows you to admit when it’s actually your fault and not a bad beat.

The more you learn, the harder it gets. The better you get, the worse you are—because the flaws that you wouldn’t even think of looking at before are now visible and need to be addressed. If you want to grow, if you want to progress, you need to always dig deeper. It’s fine to be proud at some milestones, like cashing in an international event—but it’s also important to stay focused on the bigger picture, and remain aware of how much you have yet to accomplish. It’s important not to let a minor victory lull you into thinking you’re doing great, when all you’re doing is better than before but not good enough to actually make it count.

It’s fitting that in order to get to Cotai, you must go through a profound displacement, not only in space but in time. One of the longest nonstop flights in the world, from New York to Hong Kong, followed by an hour-long ferry ride over the South China Sea to old Macau, followed by yet another trip over the island and to its new gambling home on Cotai. The City of Dreams, a large, stand-alone complex of hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues, seems like an odd, almost alien-looking Vegas. There are all the same hotels and landmarks, but with a Martian quality. A stillness and humidity to the air that make it hard to breathe, coupled with a faint tinge of sewage—a new hotel has just opened across the street and seems to be experiencing difficulties in its first days. Futuristic new constructions. And the feeling that something is hiding underneath the surface—but not necessarily something you’d really want to drag up into the open.

In yet a third, a man almost died in the emergency room after overdosing on pills. He’d been in a drug trial for depression and decided to end his life with the antidepressants he’d been prescribed. His vitals were so bad when he was admitted that doctors didn’t think he would make it—until they discovered his blood was completely clear of any drugs. He’d been taking a placebo. Once he found out he had not in fact taken a life-threatening quantity of pills, he recovered quickly. The effect our mind has on our body makes for a scary proposition.

In 1979, Carl Sagan wrote about the awe of the universe in his notebooks, as a counterpoint to the irrationality of superstition and false belief. “We live in a universe where atoms are made in the stars; where life is sparked by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where the raw material for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion of a star halfway across the Galaxy,” Sagan reflects. “How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstition and pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science, that characteristically human endeavor—imperfect and incomplete surely, but the best means to understand the world that we know.”

Elizabeth reported home with determined cheer, delighting in her airy room with its snow-white walls and large windows, open to the spring breeze and a view of the meadows and the city beyond. “I feel disposed to shut out all business remembrances, listen to the little birds warbling outside, & pay you a spiritual visit,” she wrote. “No infection I fancy will travel with the paper.” Her room was located off the female syphilis ward. Today penicillin is effective at the first sign of genital sores, but in 1848, eight decades before its discovery, most women ill enough to end up at Blockley were deep into the debilitating and disfiguring tertiary stage of the disease: seizures, incontinence, blindness, dementia, and necrotic lesions that ate away the bones of jaw and face and skull. The collapsed profile characteristic of advanced cases was known as “saddle nose.” Blockley’s patients were likely also suffering the effects of earlier attempts to cure them. “One night with Venus, a lifetime with Mercury,” went the adage. Mercury—in the form of calomel ointment or pills—was used to burn away syphilitic sores and purge infection, but the intense excretion and salivation it caused led to kidney damage and eroded gums, and then there were the cognitive effects of mercury poisoning. The righteous uninfected saw these afflictions as appropriate punishment for promiscuity. Blockley’s syphilis ward was a gallery of misery. Its inmates had no idea what to make of the studious newcomer in their midst, and Elizabeth, at least initially, was at first equally innocent of the circumstances that might have led to their hospitalization. “Most of the women are unmarried, a large proportion having lived at service and been seduced by their masters,” she noted. “I found no instance of a married woman living with her husband entering.” She could hear them lurking outside her door; in response, she moved her desk to a position in line with the keyhole, in full view of the curious. “It was thought that my residence there might act as a check on these very disorderly inmates,” she wrote, but their impact on her was more profound. Her awareness of their plight, once she came to understand its origins in prostitution and “the hideousness of modern fornication,” would resonate later in her career.

Let us not shrink from using the short expressive phrase, even if it is conversational.” The resulting prose, he wrote, “may at first seem rough as compared with the flat surface of officialese jargon.
