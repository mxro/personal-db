Then, they hired a bunch of writers, both famous and not-so-famous, to invent a story “that attributed significance” to each object. Finally, they listed each object on eBay, using the invented stories as the object’s description, and whatever they had originally paid for the object as the auction’s starting price.

If I had all the time in the universe, I couldn't truly appreciate it. But knowing that my clock is ticking and that every new day brings one fewer sunrise for me to gaze upon, that makes every sight more colorful, every smell sweeter, and every song lovelier. I want to make the most of every moment. Then, when the end finally does come, I will be ready for it.”

As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the ""half empty or half full"" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired: ""How heavy is this glass of water?""Answers called out ranged from 8 oz. to 20 oz.
She replied, ""The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.""
She continued, ""The stresses and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt.And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed – incapable of doing anything.""Remember to put the glass down:)

"Golis et al ","In 1962, Thomas S. Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was published. This book effectively demolished the commonly held view of science being an objective progression towards the truth. Instead, Kuhn established a different philosophy. He said each science had several theories that were widely accepted by nearly all the scientists involved. They conducted continuous experiments ‘confirming’ these generally held theories. This type of work he called ‘normal’ science. Gradually more and more experiments would generate complications to the theory that would destroy a theory’s initial simple elegance. Then an individual would inevitably put forward a radical new theory, which would explain all the earlier idiosyncrasies but would meet violent opposition from the established scientific community. Kuhn called this the paradigm shift. Afterwards, when the new paradigm had been accepted, the scientists rewrote the history of science to reinforce the idea of steady progression.",Enterprise and Venture Capital,"Business, Research Methodology, Science, Scientific Method",,,,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1256

1. Markets, competitors, technology, customers, government regulations, etc may change frequently and radically, although most ordinary journeys are over pretty static terrain. 
2. Whereas the road map you buy in a shop is fairly clear, the route map of this business plan journey may well be quite unclear in places: sadly you can’t see all the obstacles or enemies until you are right on top of them. 
3. Your destination may change between different versions of a business plan as conditions change and you re-evaluate your situation.

He had no interest in the smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman, Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with homemade techniques that were different to the point of apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyncratic sounds as a pointillist painter might place dots of red and green side by side on his canvas, finding inspiration in their technical limitations (“With a musician who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less opportunity to create”). [..] It is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden, the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. “I never did like anything Ellington ever did,” he said. “He never had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality and bad blend.” What Teagarden meant, whether he knew it or not, was that the band had an unconventional tone quality, one that had little in common with received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.",Duke,"Collaboration, Improvisation, Innovation",,,,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1268

Robert A. Caro,"Politics was already changing, becoming more scientific, more technical, more media-oriented. Polling, for example, was growing more common. But no politician in Texas had ever used polls as Johnson wanted to use them. A statewide poll in the 1940s cost about $6,000, so politicians commissioned them sparingly, perhaps once a month, three or four during a campaign at most. Johnson wanted polling done not monthly but weekly, and each week he wanted nearly identical polls done not by one firm but two or three. “He wanted to be able to compare them on every point,” Ed Clark recalls. Johnson was talking not about three or four polls but thirty or forty. And as Johnson explained to his advisers what type of polls he wanted, the more perceptive of them realized that their Chief was talking about something new to politics: he wanted polls that revealed not only voter preferences, but the depth of those preferences, how the preferences were changing—and how they might be changed [..]",The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Means of Ascent,"Marketing, Politics",,,,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1276

Thich Nhat Hanh,"A mantra is a kind of magic formula that, once uttered, can entirely change a situation. It can change us, and it can change others. But this magic formula must be spoken in concentration, with body and mind focused as one. What you say in this state of being becomes a mantra.
[...]
The most precious gift you can give to the one you love is your true presence. So the first mantra is very simple: “Dear one, I am here for you.”
[...]
The second mantra is, “Darling, I know you are there, and I am so happy.”
[...]
So what you can do — right away — is to manifest your true presence to your beloved and say the mantra with all your mindfulness: “Dear one, I know you are suffering. That is why I am here for you.”

To put it another way, he saw the ways in which the natural-gas industry resembled commodity businesses like wheat and pork bellies and especially financial services, where money itself is the commodity. That no natural-gas executives shared his vision didn’t bother Skilling in the least; other energy executives, he believed, were hidebound, unimaginative, and hemmed in by the past. Never having worked in the industry before joining Enron—never having run any business before joining Enron—Skilling felt no such constraints. He fervently believed that he saw the way the industry should operate, and for him, “should” and “would” were pretty much the same.

We had to deliver a treatment and a script that was totally understandable to Bob, because if Bob didn’t understand it, then it had no hope in the big wide world!

Having no allegiance to Tolkien, Bob Weinstein also felt free to offer suggestions for improving the original plot. At one point Bob said, ‘So there’s these four hobbits, right? And, you know, they go on this adventure and none of the hobbits die?’ Well, no, we explained, Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin all survive…‘Well, we can’t have that,’ he said, ‘we’ve got to kill a hobbit! I don’t care which one; you can pick–I’m not telling you who it should be: you pick out who you want to kill, but we’ve really got to kill one of those hobbits!’ In situations like that, you just nod and smile and say, ‘Well, that’s something we can consider…’ It’s not a very useful tactic to sit there and say, ‘I don’t think killing off a hobbit’s a very good idea…’ because you’d then get into an hour-long debate about why you should or shouldn’t kill a hobbit. It’s better to disengage when the silly ideas happen and say, ‘Well, we’ll think about that…’ and then you go away and hope it will get forgotten!

Trust me, if you have a baby all your arguments will seem so unimportant. Having a baby will bring you closer together.’ Mrs Bradbury mentioned this conversation to her husband in a rare moment of domestic truce, and they considered the idea. They had always thought it might be nice to have a baby (this was one of the few things they’d ever agreed on) and the more they thought about it, the more it did seem that having a baby would indeed help them to stop arguing.

Empires succeed each other, civilisations leave their remains in them like geological strata, but they preserve their character through the ages, their peculiar ambience, the sound and rhythm which distinguish them from all other cities upon earth. Naples is one of these cities, and appears to the traveller today, as it was in the Middle Ages, and doubtless a thousand years before, half-African, half-Latin, with its terraced alleys, its street-cries, its smells of olive oil, charcoal, saffron and frying fish, its sun coloured dust, the sound of bells ringing on the necks of horses and of mules. The Greeks founded it, the Romans conquered it, the barbarians despoiled it, the Byzantines and the Normans each in turn took possession of it as masters. But they did no more than modify a little the architecture of its houses and add certain superstitions, a few legends, to the traditions of its streets. The population is neither Greek, Roman nor Byzantine; the people are Neapolitan in perpetuity, a population distinct from all others in the world. Their gaiety is but a facade concealing the tragedy of poverty, their magniloquence an accent relieving the monotony of the daily round, their leisure a virtue in refusing to pretend to be busy when there is in fact nothing -to do; its population is life-loving, meeting the setbacks of fate with guile, with a gift of speech and a contempt for all things military because peace never becomes boring.",The Strangled Queen,Good Writing,,,,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1398

James Suzman,"I grew up in a society that valued work, and being able to work hard, very highly. It was only in looking at the Bushmen that I saw how our attitudes toward work are this kind of elementary particle to our society. Where does this come from? It obviously didn’t come from our lives as hunters and gatherers, who were content to work as little as possible. There wasn’t this obsession with being busy, with full employment, with having enough for everyone to do all the time. It became clearer and clearer that this was a product of the agricultural revolution and what it forced on us, placing this premium on labor. And so many modern institutions and behaviors seem contingent on this. At the same time, a lot of these institutions are seemingly at odds with the way we’re able to live now. The agricultural revolution was sort of an accidental one, and once we developed it we became hostage to it. The population became hostage to its own growth, and this has shaped a huge amount of the economic and intellectual architecture of our modern culture. We’re still obsessed with growing, even when there’s not much room left to grow in.",,"Better World, Economy, Funny, Problem, Productivity, Success",,,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/books/james-suzman-affluence-without-abundance.html,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1409

You must not learn the other, oh beware!

Division tears my life in two.
One loves the world, it clutches her, it binds
Itself to her, clinging with furious lust;
The other longs to soar beyond the dust
Into the realm of high ancestral minds.
Are there no spirits moving in the air,
Ruling the region between earth and sky?
Come down then to me from your golden mists on high,
Give me a magic cloak to carry me
Away to some far place, some land untold,
And I'd not part with it for silk or gold
Or a king's crown, so precious it would be!

We can envision mind consciousness as a living room and store consciousness as a basement. If we water a seed of joy, that seed will manfest itself on the upper level of mind consciousness, making the living room beautiful. If we water the seed of anger or hatred, it will make the living room of our mind a hell for us and our loved ones. We all have a seed of anger, a seed of despair, and a seed of jealousy in us. If you live in a negative environment, the environment can trigger these seeds. If you live in a positive environment, then the seeds of craving, violence, hate, and anger are not touched, not watered easily. So it is wise for you to choose a good environment that will prevent these negative seeds from being touched often.

an animal with one instinctual deception in its repertoire has some advantage over an animal with none, but that advantage is lost when it meets a predator who knows how to decipher the deception. Then it is stuck, trapped in its own defense.

Washington’s ragtime pianists gathered there, and Duke spent hours standing next to the house piano, listening to their varied styles and trying to learn from their example. “It wasn’t very long,” he remembered, “before I could hear a tune and after a few moments I could reproduce it, often adding different variations. Soon I began to play for small dances and house parties.” Why had Mrs. Clinkscales’s lessons failed to pique the interest of a child who was so sensitive to music that hearing it made him weep? “There was no connection between me and music, until I started fiddling with it myself,” he explained. “As far as anyone teaching me, there was too many rules and regulations, and I just couldn’t be shackled into that.

,"Research on acquiring skills shows that, roughly speaking, and pretty much independently of whether we are talking about a physical activity or an intellectual one, people tend to go through three phases while they improve their performance. During the first phase, the beginner focuses her attention simply on understanding what it is that the task requires and on not making mistakes. In phase two, such conscious attention to the basics of the task is no longer needed, and the individual performs quasi-automatically and with reasonable proficiency. Then comes the difficult part. Most people get stuck in phase two: they can do whatever it is they set out to do decently, but stop short of the level of accomplishment that provides the self-gratification that makes one’s outlook significantly more positive or purchases the external validation that results in raises and promotions. Phase three often remains elusive because while the initial improvement was aided by switching control from conscious thought to intuition—as the task became automatic and faster—further improvement requires mindful attention to the areas where mistakes are still being made and intense focus to correct them. Referred to as 'deliberate practice,' this phase is quite distinct from mindless or playful practice.",Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to A More Meaningful Life,"Learning, Mastery",,,,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1700

Instead of embracing any, Akbar inaugurated a new religion – known as Din Ilahi, ‘The Divine Faith’ – that would unite his people without compelling them to forgo their original beliefs. His was a loosely defined faith in which the principles of reincarnation and karma were accepted and forgiveness, toleration and kindness towards all living things were encouraged. Ten vices and ten virtues were enumerated. The sun was worshipped as the body of the divinity, and unification with God was the ultimate aim. Because ‘the divine will manifests itself in the intuition of kings’, Akbar himself was the only conduit between the divine and humanity, but was never clear as to whether he was claiming any divine status for himself. He changed his coinage by inscribing on it the words ‘Allah Akbar’ rather than, as previously, just his name.

In his rigidly compartmentalized life, each hour was tightly budgeted, whether for business, religion, family, or exercise. Perhaps these daily rituals helped him to deal with underlying tensions that might otherwise have become ungovernable, for although he tried to project an air of unhurried calm, he was under terrific strain in creating his oil empire.",Titan,"Habits, Productivity, Success",,,,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1842

Jocelyn K. Glei,"Baumeister suggests many strategies for increasing self-control. One of these strategies is to develop a seemingly unrelated habit, such as improving your posture or saying “yes” instead of “yeah” or flossing your teeth every night before bed. This can strengthen your willpower in other areas of your life. Additionally, once the new habit is ingrained and can be completed without much effort or thought, that energy can then be turned to other activities requiring more self-control.

Jocelyn K. Glei,"I think one of the biggest factors is progression markers. For many things, it’s hard to figure out how much progress you’re making. When you answer a thousand e-mails, you see every e-mail you answer. When you are thinking about a difficult problem, it feels like maybe there were thirty wasted hours and then finally you had a half hour at the end that was useful—because the idea kind of came to you. There isn’t a linear progression and a sense of progress.

Jocelyn K. Glei,"Even if you have cast-iron willpower, the mere fact that the Internet is lying in wait on your computer takes a toll on your work performance. The very act of resisting temptations eats up concentration and leaves you mentally depleted. Psychologists demonstrated this in a 2011 study. Participants at the University of Copenhagen were told to perform a computer task. Afterward, some of them were allowed to watch a funny video, while the others were faced with a play button for the video, but had to resist pressing it (akin to a tempting YouTube clip on your computer). When confronted with an additional task afterward, those who had to resist the video performed worse than those who were allowed to watch it.","Manage Your Day-to-Day: Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind (The 99U Book Series)","Self Control, Study",,,,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1868

,"“Dad’s writing process was simple — he’d get an idea, brainstorm a few notes, then write the first chapter. Next he’d develop an outline from one to 10 pages. He followed the outline carefully, relying on it to dictate the narrative. He composed his first drafts longhand, wearing rubber thimbles on finger and thumb. Writing with a felt-tip pen, he produced 20 to 40 pages in a sitting. Upon completion of a full draft, he transcribed the material to his typewriter, revising as he went. Most writers get more words per page as they go from longhand to a typed manuscript, but not Dad. His handwriting was small, and he used ampersands and abbreviations. His first drafts were often the same length as the final ones.”",,"Process, Writing",,,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/magazine/my-dad-the-pornographer.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,,,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",1989

He conducted gubernatorial business only until about four o’clock in the afternoon, and then, closing the door to his private office, began what, in his biographer’s words, “he considered his real work.” Part of that work was answering mail. Routine correspondence was disposed of by his assistants, but if a letter, whether from a prominent figure or a farmer, dealt in any depth with a governmental issue, Russell insisted on answering it—in detail—himself. And part of the work was reading: novels (Borodino was almost as real to him as Gettysburg, so many times had he reread War and Peace: decades later, during a tour of Russia, he would be guided around that battlefield by an expert on the battle, who realized, as he was talking with this American, that he was talking to another expert), biographies, works of history: Roman historians and Greek historians, and English—Livy and Thucydides and Macaulay—works that described how kings and emperors and prime ministers had handled issues.",The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate,,,page 272 (Location 4167-4175),,"January 5, 2015 11:42 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",2051

Robert A. Caro,"The most significant aspect of the first report of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee was not its contents but the way it was presented. During his entire career, Lyndon Johnson had demonstrated, again and again, a remarkable proficiency in the mechanics of politics, in the lower-level, basic techniques that are essential to political success but that some politicians never seem to learn. Lyndon Johnson had never had to learn these techniques. From the moment he entered politics—from those first Hill Country campaigns, now so many years behind him—he had seemed to know them, to know them instinctively, and to practice them with a rare ingenuity, a resourcefulness, a sureness of touch, as unerring as it was untaught. In a democracy, the bedrock of political power is public support, so one of the most basic requirements for a public official is the ability to influence public opinion, and the journalists who mold it. None of the lower arts of politics is more essential to the politician than the ability to obtain favorable publicity, and the subcommittee’s first report demonstrated that its chairman was a master of that art. Although most of what the report said was neither new nor significant, Johnson made it seem new and significant—by saying it in phrases brilliantly calculated to catch the journalistic eye. Some of these phrases were written by Johnson’s little wordsmith— contained in the draft report Horace Busby brought into Johnson’s office. Some were Johnson’s own, written onto the draft in his bold handwriting, the phrases of a great storyteller who all his life had displayed a gift for the dramatic. Phrases like “darkest days” “business as usual” “too little and too late” leapt out of the final report. “During the darkest days of the Korean crisis, evidence was found of a ‘business as usual’ attitude in some quarters charged with responsibility in the preparedness program,” it said. “We must not have too little and be too late in our rubber program.” The report was infused with a sense of drama: the subcommittee, it said, was trying “to make certain that we are not continuing to demobilize with one hand while trying to mobilize with the other.” The subcommittee, it said, “has fought at every Government level for a maximum reactivation of our synthetic-rubber producing program. The word fought is used advisedly.” Its prose was aggressive. Noting that the subcommittee had asked the National Munitions Board to discuss the rubber program, and “to date no reply or acknowledgment has been received,” it said: “Either the Munitions Board has a program or it has not. If it has a program it could readily be described. If it has no program it should be candidly admitted.” There was urgency in the report—a shout of warning, a call to arms: “We face the distinct threat of a war of attrition…. Not only the Nation’s security but its very existence is challenged….” And Johnson had thought up one phrase that was particularly original and vivid, and Busby happily included it in the press release he handed to newspapermen along with the report: “If we find in the other fields into which we move the same siesta psychology that we found in surplus disposal and rubber, our work is certainly cut out for us.” The next morning Johnson’s phrase",The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate,,,page 474 (Location 7265-7288),,"January 15, 2015 10:59 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",2065

They just fade away.” And like the soldier of the ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away—an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty.

Their assurance, if not their resentment, had greatly weakened when they saw the sumptuousness of Tolomei's house. They were impressed by the wealth they saw on every hand, the large staff of servants better dressed than they were themselves, the tapestries, the carved furniture, the enamels, and the ivories of which merely one of the more inferior pieces would have sufficed to rebuild Cressay. `When it comes to the point,' they each said to themselves without daring to admit it to the other, `we may very well have been wrong to show ourselves so touchy about the question of blue blood; a fortune such as this is well worth the rank of a noble.'",The Accursed Kings 03: The Poisoned Crown,,,page 212 (Location 3238-3248),,"April 26, 2015 4:10 AM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",2159

Today penicillin is effective at the first sign of genital sores, but in 1848, eight decades before its discovery, most women ill enough to end up at Blockley were deep into the debilitating and disfiguring tertiary stage of the disease: seizures, incontinence, blindness, dementia, and necrotic lesions that ate away the bones of jaw and face and skull. The collapsed profile characteristic of advanced cases was known as “saddle nose.” Blockley’s patients were likely also suffering the effects of earlier attempts to cure them. “One night with Venus, a lifetime with Mercury,” went the adage. Mercury—in the form of calomel ointment or pills—was used to burn away syphilitic sores and purge infection, but the intense excretion and salivation it caused led to kidney damage and eroded gums, and then there were the cognitive effects of mercury poisoning. The righteous uninfected saw these afflictions as appropriate punishment for promiscuity. Blockley’s syphilis ward was a gallery of misery. Its inmates had no idea what to make of the studious newcomer in their midst, and Elizabeth, at least initially, was at first equally innocent of the circumstances that might have led to their hospitalization. “Most of the women are unmarried, a large proportion having lived at service and been seduced by their masters,” she noted. “I found no instance of a married woman living with her husband entering.” She could hear them lurking outside her door; in response, she moved her desk to a position in line with the keyhole, in full view of the curious. “It was thought that my residence there might act as a check on these very disorderly inmates,” she wrote, but their impact on her was more profound.

Whether it may be good or bad, whether living according to it would be suffering or joy, I do not wish to discuss, possibly this is not essential—but the uniformity of the world, that everything which happens is connected, that the great and the small things are all encompassed by the same forces of time, by the same law of causes, of coming into being and of dying, this is what shines brightly out of your exalted teachings, oh perfected one. But according to your very own teachings, this unity and necessary sequence of all things is nevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of unity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had not been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be proven: these are your teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation.

Carl Safina,"But the fact is, many other animals find much of our music somewhere between uninteresting and annoying. Given a choice of human music, two species of monkeys preferred slow tempos to fast, Mozart to rock; but given a choice among various types of human music and none—they preferred silence. It looks, however, like that was because they were subjected to human music. Human music presents sounds and rhythms corresponding to human characteristics. When tamarin monkeys were played calming human music and agitating human music, they calmed in response to both. The “fast” music that agitates humans had a beat merely matching the resting heart rate of the monkeys. Humans feel it as invigorating, but to the tamarins it was nothing to get excited about. How about translating the things that make human music appealing to humans—and creating monkey music? Well, researchers did that. They looked at the frequency range, tempos, and pitch changes of the vocalizations of cotton-top tamarin monkeys and their heart rates. (For instance, while almost all human music is pitched between 200 and 900 hertz, tamarin threat calls come in frequencies of 1,600 to 2,000 hertz.) The researchers then created music within those parameters. They avoided imitating tamarin calls; used human musical techniques such as counterpoint lines, ending phrases with resolution to a chord; and applied a structure such as A-B-A. They wrote music intended to be calming and music intended to get the monkeys agitated. The music was played on a cello. It was the world’s first tamarin music. The monkeys responded to the monkey music as the composers had intended. After hearing the calming monkey music, the monkeys moved less and ate more. After hearing the agitating music, they tended to sit up and take notice. Music composed for monkeys appeared to evoke the intended kind of emotional responses. (The researchers noted, “We and others who have listened to the tamarin music do not find it particularly pleasant and one might suspect that the tamarins might react to human music in a similar way.”)",Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel,,,page 227 (Location 3471-3486),,"September 30, 2016 12:56 AM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",2887

Justice: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty. Moderation: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. Cleanliness: Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation. Tranquility: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.

What do you have against poor Gulbahar?’ ‘Oh, it’s not for Chota!’ Jahan told him everything – how he had lost his peace of mind because of another elephant and another mahout. He expected Balaban to make a wisecrack at his expense, but when he finished the Gypsy nodded solemnly and said, ‘Don’t sorrow. We’ll help.’ Jahan took out the pouch he had brought and put it on the table. ‘Is that from the Sultan or from you?’ Balaban inquired. ‘The Sultan knows nothing about this. He shouldn’t.’ ‘Then keep it,’ Balaban said in his crisp, jovial way. ‘Now go. We’ll find you.’ Jahan returned to the menagerie. In his head a witch’s brew fermented – shame, hope, guilt. Two days later a boy came looking for him, carrying a jar. ‘Somebody sent you this.’ Jahan studied him – the bright black eyes, the dimpled smile, the olive skin. No doubt he was related to Balaban. Inside the jar there was a powder the colour of turmeric. He dipped in the tip of his finger and tasted it. It had a mild flavour, a bit salty. It could blend into anything. Smuggling pomegranate sherbet from the kitchen, he mixed it with a spoonful of powder. The moment Buziba left he gave the drink to his elephant, who guzzled it happily. Not a thing happened. Next day he tried again, increasing the dose. Again, naught. He poured the entire powder into Mahmood’s rice gruel and watched the elephant cram it all down.

But a wave is, at the same time, water. Water is the ground of being of the wave. It is important that a wave knows that she is water, and not just a wave. We, too, live our life as an individual. We believe that we have a beginning and an end, that we are separate from other living beings. That is why the Buddha advised us to look more deeply in order to touch the ground of our being, which is nirvana. Everything bears deeply the nature of nirvana. Everything has been ""nirvanized."" That is the teaching of the Lotus Sutra. We look deeply, and we touch the suchness of reality.

What goes on in the mind when it evaluates how much one thing is like, or not like, another? The process is so fundamental to our existence that we scarcely stop to think about it. “It’s the process that grinds away constantly and generates much of our understanding and response to the world,” says Berkeley psychologist Dacher Keltner. “First of all it’s, how do you categorize things? And that’s everything. Do I sleep with him or not? Do I eat this or not? Do I give to this person or not? Is that a boy or a girl? Is that a predator or prey? If you solve how the process works, you solve how we know things. It’s how knowledge about the world is organized.

He urged me to do a divination. I remained evenly in the natural state for a while, and, within this sky-like evenness, I looked to see what the cursed object might be. I saw that under a large wooden case of butter was an old offering lamp with a short stand and a broken rim. Curious as to its origin, I saw that it had been taken out of a pond by the lady of the house five years before, and because of this, she was suffering recurrent difficulties with her right hand. All these images arose clearly in my mind. As I related this to my patron, his faith grew stronger and he said, “Grant us your protection—though you keep it hidden, you have unimpeded prescience.” Saying this, he left. Thereafter, when people insisted on having me perform a divination, I was able, after remaining for a while in equanimity, to know the good and the bad of things. Thinking that such prescience might prove quite presumptuous and unreliable, and realizing that all this might invite disturbances and create obstacles to my practice, I later kept silent about such matters and claimed to know nothing [48b].",The Life of Shabkar,"Buddhism, Funny, Magic, Story",⭐️⭐️⭐️,page 198 (Location 3021-3031),,"October 26, 2017 11:32 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3685

"Caro, Robert A","Advised that 2,000 WPA laborers assigned to Park Department projects would be reassigned at the beginning of the month so that work could begin on new nonpark projects (including three ultramodern firehouses for La Guardia's beloved Fire Department) and that 3,000 more men per month would be reassigned thereafter, Moses rumbled that if he had to lay off men, some among them would be playground supervisors; some playgrounds would therefore have to be closed, a step sure to touch off a furious public reaction. About to leave by train for a national conference of mayors in Los Angeles, La Guardia flatly ordered him not to do so, threatening to fire him if he did. Moses defied him. While the Union Pacific Streamliner was speeding the Mayor across country, the Park Commissioner struck: he didn't take some of the 2,000 men from playground duty; he took them all, and with them every piece of movable playground equipment, even the seats of the swings. And then he ordered 142 playgrounds padlocked. Telephoning frantically from pay phones at each Union Pacific stop, La Guardia ordered Police Commissioner Valentine to open the playgrounds—by force if necessary. The police were forced to cut the locks when Moses refused to surrender the keys to Valentine, and though the play areas were technically open, the Park Department was empowered by city regulations to hold on to the equipment it had removed, and the city's mothers, confronted by pistol-toting policemen instead of the familiar supervisory personnel—as well as by firmly locked toilets that were usually available to their youngsters—rallied behind the Park Commissioner. By the time the Mayor came home, he was confronted by a hostile public, to whom Moses had already taken his case.

"Caro, Robert A","There comes a time, H. L. Mencken said, when every normal man is tempted ""to spit on his hands, haul up the black flag and begin slitting throats."" The LIRR's conductors were not responsible for conditions on the railroad. The commuters knew that—rationally. But the conductors were a visible symbol of the railroad's management on which the commuters could vent their frustration. Men normally rational found themselves snarling and cursing conductors, refusing to show them their tickets; as a result, men who would not have been able to conceive of themselves being arrested suddenly found themselves in that state. ""Arrested!"" as one reporter put it: ""Portly, balding, mild-mannered, 53-year-old Seymour Cummins, district sales manager, commuter, family man. Seymour Cummins, of all people, being led off the train by two policemen, one on each arm, as his wife watched in disbelief."" By 1968, the year Robert Moses left power, commuters were, as one writer put it, ""so . . . surly that the conductors occasionally choose, like prudent lion tamers, not to enter the cage."" One freezing evening, at Jamaica, while commuters huddled in downstairs waiting rooms because the waiting rooms near the tracks upstairs were unheated, a malfunctioning public-address system prevented them from hearing announcements of incoming trains. Storming upstairs in sudden senseless fury, 250 commuters began pounding on the glass walls of the announcer's booth, trying to get at the terrified occupant—they had broken the glass when police arrived to pull them away. On another freezing night, a train broke down some miles from the nearest station. Its passengers got off and began throwing rocks at it. Similar incidents occurred again and again. One evening in Penn Station— with 150 rush-hour trains running late—a fifty-eight-year-old bank employee from Bayside, enraged because a conductor would not open the doors to let him on a train that had loaded but had been standing for close to half an hour on the platform, reached through the window to the engineer's booth, grabbed something and refused to let go. And when the railroad police rushed up to pull him away, suddenly, as one police sergeant put it, ""this place was wall-to-wall people, thousands of people""—pulling at the policemen, punching them. ""It was a riot down there,"" the sergeant said. ""It was actually a riot.""

"Wilson, Edward O.","ANTHROPOLOGISTS RECOGNIZE THREE levels of complexity among human societies. At the simplest level, hunter-gatherer bands and small agricultural villages are by and large egalitarian. Leadership status is granted individuals on the basis of intelligence and bravery, and through their aging and death it is passed to others, whether close kin or not. Important decisions in egalitarian societies are made during communal feasts, festivals, and religious celebrations. Such is the practice of the few surviving hunter-gatherer bands, scattered in remote areas, mostly in South America, Africa, and Australia, and closest in organization to those prevailing over thousands of years prior to the Neolithic era. Chiefdoms, the next level of complexity, also called rank societies, are ruled by an elite stratum who upon debility or death are replaced by members of their family or at least those of equivalent hereditary rank. That was the dominant form of societies around the world at the beginning of recorded history. Chiefs or “big men” rule by prestige, largesse, the support of elite members below them—and retribution against those who oppose them. They live on the surplus accumulated by the tribe, employing it to tighten control upon the tribe, to regulate trade, and to wage war with neighbors. Chiefs exercise authority only on the people immediately around them or in nearby villages, with whom they interact as needed on a daily basis. In practice this means subjects who can be reached within half a day traveling by foot. The reach is thus a maximum of twenty-five to thirty miles. It is to the advantage of chiefs to micromanage the affairs of their domain, delegating as little authority as possible in order to reduce the chance of insurrection or fission. Common tactics include the suppression of underlings and the fomenting of fear of rival chiefdoms.",The Social Conquest of Earth,,,page 109 (Location 1657-1671),,"June 22, 2015 7:27 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",2263

His point is that the pleasure of imitation comes not from a direct copy in the same medium, but through the skill involved in producing an imitation of a subject in a different medium. Using the examples of painting, sculpture, music, poetry, and dancing, Smith develops an analysis of different forms of imitation and the aesthetic pleasure that are elicited in each medium.

That artificial beings, or aliens, or even very different animals here on Earth, are by definition incapable of feeling pain?” We don’t want to say that, and we don’t have to.

Mouth: The mouth is very slightly open so that the jaw is relaxed and air can move easily through both the mouth and nose. The tip of the tongue can be placed on the roof of the mouth.

Martin Seligman,"Edwin Boring, Herbert Langfeld, and Samuel Fernberger, the chairmen of Harvard, Princeton, and Penn, respectively, met at lunch and agreed that psychology should be more like physics and chemistry—doing basic research only—and that they would hire no applied psychologists. All the rest of academia immediately fell into line.” This decision was a momentous error. For an insecure science like psychology in 1946, imitating physics and chemistry might have earned some brownie points with deans, but it made no sense at all scientifically. Physics was preceded by an ancient science of engineering, which actually solved problems, before it grafted on abstract, basic research. Applied physics predicted eclipses, floods, and the motions of heavenly bodies—and it coined money. Isaac Newton ran the British mint in 1696. Chemists made gunpowder and learned an enormous amount of scientific fact even as they pursued what turned out to be the dead-end of trying to turn lead into gold. These real-world problems and applications set the boundaries for the basic puzzles applied physics would then go on to unravel. Psychology, in contrast, had no engineering—nothing that was proven to work in the real world—no underpinning that would guide and constrain what its basic research should be about. Good science requires the interplay of analysis and synthesis. One never knows if basic research is truly basic until one knows what it is basic to. Modern physics came into its own not because of its theories—which can be enormously counterintuitive and highly controversial (muons, wavicles, superstrings, the anthropic principle, and all that)—but because physicists built the atomic bomb and modern nuclear power plants. Immunology, a backwater enterprise in medical research in the 1940s, came into its own on the back of the Salk and Sabin vaccines against polio.

They are my offering to the Three Jewels. Listen to me, mountain dweller: The yogin for whom all phenomena appear as scriptures Is satisfied with the book of the phenomenal world. You, so-called “hermit,” collecting all sorts of scribbling, Stagger under the weight Of your load of worn-out books. If these books and instructions Are not present within your own mind, Why should you carry such a burden of writings?

For those with such awareness, Outer phenomena all teach impermanence and death. I, the flower, will now give you, the yogin, A bit of helpful advice On death and on impermanence.

When a fine rain falls, My petals wrap around me [46b]; When the sun shines I open like a smile. Right now I look well enough, But I won’t last long, Not at all.

When others praise you, you dance with joy; When faithful patrons turn up, You sit in a dignified manner; When they shower you with lavish food, You smile with satisfaction. Right now, you look well enough. But you won’t last long, Not at all. Unwelcome aging will steal away Your healthy vigor; Your hair will whiten And your back will grow bent.

"Caro, Robert A","Robert Moses had never, since he had first come to power, allowed himself any time for reflection, for thought. Reflection, thought, is in a sense no more than the putting to use of a mind, and the unique instrument that was Robert Moses' mind could conceive wonders when it was put to work in that way. As a youth, he had never had enough to do; frustrated at the Bureau of Municipal Research, he had spent his evenings walking the city and thinking—and gradually his steps had led him more and more frequently to Riverside Park, and he had conceived a solution for problems for which no other man had been able to conceive a solution. As only a part-time aide to Al Smith, he had a lot to do—but not nearly enough to use up all his restless energy, and he had had time to sail and walk around the South Shore of Long Island. Living in Babylon and working in New York, he had had to ride the Long Island Rail Road for two hours and more a day; attempting an overview of Moses' career, it is difficult not to ascribe some of the credit for the stroke of genius that led him to see the potential for parks in the New York City watershed properties to the fact that the railroad not only carried him past those properties but trapped him on it for two hours and more a day so that he had to think about them. The following year, Robert Moses had come to power. In the years since, he had had piled upon him, and had grasped for, more and more power with each succeeding decade; the workload of executive responsibility he was carrying in the I930's was too great to allow time for reflection—a fact he mentioned worriedly to his aides. But in the logo's he had far greater executive responsibilities than in the 1930's, and in 1954, with his assumption of the chairmanship of the State Power Authority, he undertook in that one job, piled atop all his others, so much work that quiet, reflective thought was a luxury in which he could quite literally indulge almost never.",The power broker : Robert Moses and the fall of New York,,,page 1146 (Location 17571-17584),,"February 7, 2018 12:04 AM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3766

H.H. the Fourteenth Dalai Lama,"One day a poor Mongolian vagabond turned up. Rifling through my provision bags, he set about stealing one of them. At that very moment I said: Thief, you have come! Wonderful! We’ll see if I, the mountain dweller, The so-called “renunciate,” Can behave in keeping with my name. Let’s see if I have really understood The main point of the Dharma. We’ll make some tea and drink it together. If you live far away, stay here for the night. Let’s discuss both worldly and spiritual things. Then I shall give you whatever I have. Accordingly, the thief and I boiled some tea, and as we were drinking it he asked, “Where is your native land? In which monastery do you live? Do you have any family at home? What is your name?” I answered with these words: My native land is all lands, In no particular direction. My monastery is the solitary mountains, In no particular place. My family is all the beings of the six realms. My name is “Hermit Protected by the Three Jewels.” At this playful reply, the thief burst out laughing and said, “Lama, you are a gifted speaker” [49a]. Then, having given him what little I had, I sang: I pray to you, father, King of Dharma! Grant your blessings That my mind may remain free from attachment! Open your ears, thief, and listen carefully. I see everything as illusion. Having neither accumulated wealth nor craved it, I have never owned illusory possessions. Beyond what you see, I have neither food nor riches. See for yourself! Now, if you don’t know me I shall tell you frankly— I was born in Rekong Shohong; As to my father, I am a disciple of the King of Dharma, Chögyal Wang. I am a practitioner of the Great Perfection; My name is Tsogdruk Rangdrol. Having meditated again and again On all beings as my parents, I am free of the duality of enemy and friend. Having found the sublime inner wealth, I am glad to give you whatever outer wealth, Food, and possessions you desire. Now, just relax and be content. On the occasion of this virtuous action, I dedicate all merit accumulated in the past, And all to be accumulated in the future, So that you and all beings May achieve supreme Buddhahood— Such is the way of the Bodhisattvas.

For example, a low dose of homosexual-tending genes may give competitive advantages to a practicing heterosexual. Or, homosexuality may give advantages to the group by special talents, unusual qualities of personality, and the specialized roles and professions it generates. There is abundant evidence that such is the case in both preliterate and modern societies. Either way, societies are mistaken to disapprove of homosexuality because gays have different sexual preferences and reproduce less.

But like this, I’ve had a few good days, I’ve learned, had joy, I’ve neither harmed myself nor others by annoyance and hastiness.

Michael Hyatt,"But if your idea list is thin, you need idea starters. Here are thirteen of them. I offer these up as possibilities for lighting a fire when your brain is damp. (If you happen to be a novelist, see Appendix B for some specialized advice.) 1. Tell a personal story. This almost always works, because you harness the power of your own personal narrative. It is particularly good if it is dramatic and you feel the freedom to be transparent. It is helpful if you can conclude with a lesson or two that you have learned. Man of the House, a Proctor and Gamble blog especially for men, has some great examples of this. One of its bloggers, James Pilcher, blogged about telling his family he lost his job. “I’ll never forget it as long as I live . . . I was as angry, hurt, scared, and vulnerable as I ever have been.” Pilcher went on to give some excellent advice for anyone facing a job loss.1 86 2. Describe a historical event. This is very similar to using a personal story. History is full of great stories. It’s one of the reasons why I am almost always reading a history book or biography of some kind. Again, you can tell the story and distill the lessons. Erin Glover did this quite effectively, for example, when she wrote a blog for the Disney Parks Blog highlighting the 1937 premiere of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The sold-out opening night took place on December 21 that year at the Carthay Circle Theatre. Glover’s blog, written the same date seventy-four years later, was flush with historical pictures of the big night, where more than thirty thousand fans gathered outside the theater just to be part of the event. The takeaway from Glover’s blog? She was getting the buzz started for the opening of the Carthay Circle Theatre coming the next year at Disney’s California Adventure Park.2 3.

So as Descartes’s meditations continue, he realizes that he can salvage the reality of the world without ever leaving the comfort of his armchair. Not only do I think, he says to himself, but I can hold in my mind an idea of perfection—a clear and distinct idea, as a matter of fact. This idea, as well as my own existence, must have some cause, and the only possible cause is God.

The world tasted bitter. Life was torture. A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow. Dead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with an emptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was his goal.

Andrea Wulf,"Most visitors were surprised by the simplicity of Humboldt’s living arrangements: an apartment in a plain house not far from the university that his brother Wilhelm had founded. Whenever visitors arrived, they were welcomed by Seifert. He would take them to the second-floor flat where they would walk through a room filled with stuffed birds, rock specimens and other natural history objects, then on through the library and into the study where the walls were lined with yet more bookcases. The rooms overflowed with manuscripts and drawings, scientific instruments and more stuffed animals, as well as folios filled with pressed plants, rolled-up maps, busts, portraits and even a pet chameleon. There was a ‘magnificent’ leopard skin on the plain wooden floor. A parrot interrupted conversations when it shouted Humboldt’s most common instruction to his servant: ‘Much sugar, much coffee, Mr Seifert.’ Boxes cluttered the floor and the desk was surrounded by piles of books. A globe stood on one of the side tables in the library, and whenever Humboldt talked about a particular mountain, river or town he would get up and spin it. Humboldt hated the cold and kept his apartment at an almost unbearable level of tropical heat, which his visitors quietly suffered. When conversing with foreigners, Humboldt spoke in several languages at the same time, switching within a sentence between German, French, Spanish and English. Although he was losing his hearing, he had lost none of his wit. First comes deafness, he joked, and then ‘imbecility’. The only reason for his ‘celebrity’, he told an acquaintance, was because he had lived to such an old age.

"Caro, Robert A","Consider his relationship with Tom Shanahan. Shanahan's nostrils twitched to a single aroma: the smell of money. Even as a boy at the turn of the century, one of seven children of a poor Irish boilermaker, he had followed that scent to its source: the noses of his Waterbury, Connecticut, playmates may have been flattened against candy-store windows; Tom Shanahan's nose was pressed against the glass front door of Waterbury's Colonial Trust Company; reminiscing forty years later, he would recall vividly passing that building almost every day of his youth and staring inside almost every time he passed; it had been, he would say, a place of ""august halls""; from as far back as he could remember, he would say, he had wanted to be a banker. He followed the scent down to the great city after high school, but for long years he seemed to have followed it into a trap: the tall, strong young man spent seven years behind the barred windows of tellers' cages. He went to NYU at night, in 1926 earned a degree, but five years later still had a job only slightly better—assistant cashier—at one of the smallest and shakiest banks in the city, the eight-year-old Federation Bank and Trust Company. But when, in 1931, the Depression forced the infant institution to shut its doors, it was the assistant cashier who, with Federation's despairing officers ready to liquidate, thought up a complex refinancing plan that reduced the bank's obligations, personally talked a financier into loaning it the money to pay them off, and saved the bank. When it reopened, Shanahan, at twenty-nine, was its vice president and treasurer. With authority, Shanahan was able to move Federation into a field from which more conservative bankers shied: loans to construction contractors. The age of huge construction companies was still in the future; during the Depression, most of New York's contractors were small and broke. ""Tom would take a contractor who didn't have the salary to pay his workers that week, and back him,"" an associate recalls. ""He went on face value, and he very seldom went wrong."" He backed Pete Di Napoli (the story around Federation in later years was that when Di Napoli first came in to see Shanahan he had to borrow a nickel for carfare home to Queens) and the Slattery Contracting Company (which was better off, but barely) and a half dozen others, who were to make immense profits—and who deposited those profits with Federation.",The power broker : Robert Moses and the fall of New York,,,page 983 (Location 15071-15088),,"January 25, 2018 12:09 AM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3759

But happiness seems no less one-dimensional and arbitrary a quality to quantify than GDP; after all, you could be happy just because you’re three sheets to the wind – ce qu’on ne voit pas. And don’t setbacks, sorrow, and sadness have a place in a full life, too?

If the Land of Plenty is a place where everybody is happy, then it’s also a place steeped in apathy. Had women never protested, they would never have gained the vote; had African Americans never rebelled, Jim Crow might still be the law of the land.

"Wilson, Edward O.","Suppose, in contravention of this reasoning and by some means, we chose to interpret the physical laws of the universe as evidence of a supreme supernatural being. It would then be an enormous leap of faith to impute the biological history that unfolded on this planet to some divine intervention. If the evidence from biology and anthropology means anything, it would be another mistake of equal magnitude to envision, in the manner of Plato and Kant, universal ethical precepts that exist separate from the idiosyncrasies of human existence, hence the God-given moral law so eloquently posited by C. S. Lewis and other Christian apologists. There is every good reason instead to explain the origin of religion and morality as special events in the evolutionary history of humanity driven by natural selection. The evidence that lies before us in great abundance points to organized religion as an expression of tribalism. Every religion teaches its adherents that they are a special fellowship and that their creation story, moral precepts, and privilege from divine power are superior to those claimed in other religions. Their charity and other acts of altruism are concentrated on their coreligionists; when extended to outsiders, it is usually to proselytize and thereby strengthen the size of the tribe and its allies. No religious leader ever urges people to consider rival religions and choose the one they find best for their person and society. The conflict among religions is often instead an accelerant, if not a direct cause, of war. Devout believers value their faith above all else and are quick to anger if it is challenged. The power of organized religions is based upon their contribution to social order and personal security, not to the search for truth. The goal of religions is submission to the will and common good of the tribe. The illogic of religions is not a weakness in them, but their essential strength. Acceptance of the bizarre creation myths binds the members together. Among the various prominent Christian denominations, we find the belief that those who have surrendered their will to Jesus will soon ascend bodily to heaven, and those left behind will suffer for a thousand years, after which the world will end. A rival faith disagrees, but recommends communion with Christ on Earth by eating his flesh and drinking his blood—both made literal by the act of transubstantiation. For outsiders openly to doubt such dogmas is regarded an invasion of privacy and a personal insult. For insiders to raise doubt is punishable heresy. Such an intensely tribal instinct could, in the real world, arise in evolution only by group selection, tribe competing against tribe. The peculiar qualities of religious faith are the logical consequence of the dynamism at this higher level of biological organization.",The Social Conquest of Earth,,,page 264 (Location 4037-4057),,"July 5, 2015 12:05 AM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",2309

The splendor of the cosmos, spanning billions of years and countless stars, culminated in the appearance of human beings here on Earth—conscious, aware creatures, unions of soul and body, capable of appreciating and returning God’s love. Our mortal lives are part of a larger span of existence, in which we will continue to participate after our deaths. It’s an attractive story. You can see why someone would believe it, and work to reconcile it with what science has taught us about the nature of reality. Here’s a different story. The universe is not a miracle. It simply is, unguided and unsustained, manifesting the patterns of nature with scrupulous regularity. Over billions of years it has evolved naturally, from a state of low entropy toward increasing complexity, and it will eventually wind down to a featureless equilibrium. We are the miracle, we human beings. Not a break-the-laws-of-physics kind of miracle; a miracle in that it is wondrous and amazing how such complex, aware, creative, caring creatures could have arisen in perfect accordance with those laws.

Tara Brach,"Find a sitting position that allows you to be alert—spine erect but not rigid—and also relaxed. Close your eyes and rest your hands in an easy, effortless way. Allow your awareness to scan through your body and, wherever possible, soften and release obvious areas of physical tension. Because we so easily get lost in thoughts, vipassana begins with attention to the breath. Using the breath as a primary anchor of mindfulness helps quiet the mind so that you can be awake to the changing stream of life that moves through you. Take a few very full breaths, and then allow your breath to be natural. Notice where you most easily detect the breath. You might feel it as it flows in and out of your nose; you might feel the touch of the breath around your nostrils or on your upper lip; or perhaps you feel the movement of your chest or the rising and falling of your abdomen. Bring your attention to the sensations of breathing in one of these areas, perhaps wherever you feel them most distinctly. There is no need to control the breath, to grasp or fixate on it. There is no “right” way of breathing. With a relaxed awareness, discover what the breath is really like as a changing experience of sensations. You will find that the mind naturally drifts off in thoughts. Thoughts are not the enemy, and you do not need to clear your mind of thoughts. Rather, you are developing the capacity to recognize when thoughts are happening without getting lost in the story line. When you become aware of thinking, you might use a soft and friendly mental note: “Thinking, thinking.” Then, without any judgment, gently return to the immediacy of the breath. Let the breath be home base, a place of full presence. While you might notice other experiences—the sounds of passing cars, feelings of being warm or cool, sensations of hunger—they can be in the background without drawing you away. If any particular sensations become strong and call your attention, allow those sensations, instead of the breath, to become the primary subject of mindfulness. You might feel heat or chills, tingling, aching, twisting, stabbing, vibrating. With a soft, open awareness just feel the sensations as they are. Are they pleasant or unpleasant? As you fully attend to them, do they become more intense or dissipate? Notice how they change. When the sensations are no longer a strong experience, return to mindfulness of breathing. Or if the sensations are so unpleasant that you are unable to regard them with any balance or equanimity, feel free to rest your attention again in the breath. In a similar way, you can bring mindfulness to strong emotions—fear, sadness, happiness, excitement, grief Meet each experience with a kind and clear presence, neither clinging to nor resisting what is happening. What does this emotion feel like as sensations in your body? Where do you feel it most strongly? Is it static or moving? How big is it? Are your thoughts agitated and vivid? Are they repetitive and dull? Does your mind feel contracted or open? As you pay attention, notice how the emotion changes. Does it become more intense or weaken? Does it change into a different state? Anger to grief? Happiness to peace? When the emotion is no longer compelling, turn your attention back to the breath. If the emotion feels overwhelming for you, or if you are confused about where to place your attention, relax and come home to your breath.",Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame,,,page 50 (location 722-747),,"January 27, 2020 9:14 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",4247

"Hanh, Thich Nhat","The Buddha taught many techniques to help us calm our body and mind and look deeply at them. They can be summarized in five stages: (1) Recognition — If we are angry, we say, ""I know that anger is in me."" (2) Acceptance — When we are angry, we do not deny it. We accept what is present. (3) Embracing — We hold our anger in our two arms like a mother holding her crying baby. Our mindfulness embraces our emotion, and this alone can calm our anger and ourselves. (4) Looking deeply — When we are calm enough, we can look deeply to understand what has brought this anger to be, what is causing our baby's discomfort. (5) Insight — The fruit of looking deeply is understanding the many causes and conditions, primary and secondary, that have brought about our anger, that are causing our baby to cry. Perhaps our baby is hungry. Perhaps his diaper pin is piercing his skin. Our anger was triggered when our friend spoke to us meanly, and suddenly we remember that he was not at his best today because his father is dying.

For most of those years her home was in the old lion house—a typical twelve-by-twelve-foot cage with iron bars and a cement floor. Mohini spent her days pacing restlessly back and forth in her cramped quarters. Eventually, biologists and staff worked together to create a natural habitat for her. Covering several acres, it had hills, trees, a pond and a variety of vegetation. With excitement and anticipation they released Mohini into her new and expansive environment. But it was too late. The tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life. Mohini paced and paced in that corner until an area twelve by twelve feet was worn bare of grass.

After all, it is the psychology department that does the pure science, and we wouldn’t want people to be confused, would we?” “Will Professor Seligman go along?” wondered the dean of social science. “It is sort of insulting. An A for ‘applied’—master of applied positive psychology?” Far from being insulted, I welcomed the A. Even though Penn was founded by Benjamin Franklin to teach both the “applied” and the “ornamental,” by which he meant “not currently useful,” the ornamental has long won out, and I have labored for four decades as the “applied” maverick in an almost solely ornamental department. Pavlovian conditioning, color vision, serial-versus-parallel mental scanning, mathematical models of T-maze learning in rats, the moon illusion—these are the high-prestige enterprises in my home department. Researching the real world has a slightly fetid odor in the high reaches of academic psychology, an odor that wafted through the deans’ debate about creating the new degree. Originally, I went into psychology to relieve human suffering and to increase human well-being. I thought I was well prepared to do this, but I was actually miseducated to this task.

Martin Seligman,"All of these giants made the grand mistake of monism, in which all human motives come down to just one. Monisms get the most mileage from the fewest variables, and so they pass with flying colors the test of “parsimony,” the philosophical dictum that the simplest answer is the right answer. But there is also a lower limit on parsimony: when there are too few variables to explain the rich nuances of the phenomenon in question, nothing at all is explained. Monism is fatal to the theories of these four giants. Of these monisms, my original view was closest to Aristotle’s—that everything we do is done in order to make us happy—but I actually detest the word happiness, which is so overused that it has become almost meaningless. It is an unworkable term for science, or for any practical goal such as education, therapy, public policy, or just changing your personal life. The first step in positive psychology is to dissolve the monism of “happiness” into more workable terms.

Siddhartha Mukherjee,"Rather than focusing on individual genes mutated in cancers, they enumerated the number of pathways mutated in cancer cells. Each time a gene was mutated in any component of the Ras-Mek-Erk pathway, it was classified as a “Ras pathway” mutation. Similarly, if a cell carried a mutation in any component of the Rb signaling pathway, it was classified as “Rb pathway mutant,” and so forth, until all driver mutations had been organized into pathways. How many pathways are typically dysregulated in a cancer cell? Typically, Vogelstein found, between eleven and fifteen, with an average of thirteen. The mutational complexity on a gene-by-gene level was still enormous. Any one tumor bore scores of mutations pockmarked throughout the genome. But the same core pathways were characteristically dysregulated in any tumor type, even if the specific genes responsible for each broken pathway differed from one tumor to the next. Ras may be activated in one sample of bladder cancer; Mek in another; Erk in the third—but in each case, some vital piece of the Ras-Mek-Erk cascade was dysregulated. The bedlam of the cancer genome, in short, is deceptive. If one listens closely, there are organizational principles. The language of cancer is grammatical, methodical, and even—I hesitate to write—quite beautiful.

Tara Brach,"IN THE 1950S a few highly trained pilots in the U.S. Air Force were set a life-or-death task—to fly at altitudes higher than ever before attempted. Going beyond the earth’s denser atmosphere, they found, much to their horror, that the ordinary laws of aerodynamics no longer existed. As Tom Wolfe describes it in The Right Stuff: “. . . a plane could skid into a flat spin, like a cereal bowl on a waxed Formica counter, and then start tumbling—not spinning and diving but tumbling end over end.” The first pilots to face this challenge responded by frantically trying to stabilize their planes, applying correction after correction. The more furiously they manipulated the controls, the wilder the ride became. Screaming helplessly to ground control, “What do I do next?” they would plunge to their deaths. This tragic drama occurred several times until one of the pilots, Chuck Yeager, inadvertently struck upon a solution. When his plane began tumbling, Yeager was thrown violently around the cockpit and knocked out. Unconscious, he plummeted toward earth. Seven miles later, the plane reentered the planet’s denser atmosphere, where standard navigation strategies could be implemented. Yeager came to, steadied the craft and landed safely. He had discovered the only lifesaving response that was possible in this desperate situation: Don’t do anything. You take your hands off the controls. This solution, as Wolfe puts it, was “the only choice you had.” It countered all training and even basic survival instincts, but it worked.",Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame,"Self Control, Story, Success",,page 53 (location 761-773),,"January 27, 2020 9:21 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",4248

To the north was Niflheim, the dark world. Here eleven poisonous rivers cut through the mist, each springing from the same well at the center of it all, the roaring maelstrom called Hvergelmir. Niflheim was colder than cold, and the murky mist that cloaked everything hung heavily. The skies were hidden by mist and the ground was clouded by the chilly fog. To the south was Muspell. Muspell was fire. Everything there glowed and burned. Muspell was light where Niflheim was gray, molten lava where the mist world was frozen. The land was aflame with the roaring heat of a blacksmith’s fire; there was no solid earth, no sky. Nothing but sparks and spurting heat, molten rocks and burning embers. In Muspell, at the edge of the flame, where the mist burns into light, where the land ends, stood Surtr, who existed before the gods. He stands there now. He holds a flaming sword, and the bubbling lava and the freezing mist are as one to him. It is said that at Ragnarok, which is the end of the world, and only then, Surtr will leave his station.

It is a useless display of strength of mind; and the modesty of those who attain the highest eminence is due to a desire to appear even greater than their position.” It is also helpful to enhance reputation by what researchers have called indirect reciprocity, by which a reputation for altruism and cooperativeness accrues to an individual, even if the actions that build it are no more than ordinary. A saying in German exemplifies the tactic: Tue Gutes und rede darüber. Do good and talk about it. Doors are then opened, and opportunities for friendships and alliances increased. Since everyone knows the game, people are always willing to counter it if they safely can.

At the approach of a storm, church bells were rung to ward off the bolts. “The tones of the consecrated metal repel the demon and avert storm and lightning,” declared St. Thomas Aquinas. But even the most religiously faithful were likely to have noticed this was not very effective. During one thirty-five-year period in Germany alone during the mid-1700s, 386 churches were struck and more than one hundred bell ringers killed. In Venice, some three thousand people were killed when tons of gunpowder stored in a church was hit. As Franklin later recalled to Harvard professor John Winthrop, “The lightning seems to strike steeples of choice and at the very time the bells are ringing; yet still they continue to bless the new bells and jangle the old ones whenever it thunders.

These behaviors are learned, but the process is what psychologists call “prepared.” In prepared learning, we are innately predisposed to learn and thereby reinforce one option over another. We are “counterprepared” to make alternative choices, or even actively to avoid them. For example, we are prepared to learn a fear of snakes very quickly, proceeding easily to the point of phobia, yet we are not prepared by instinct to treat other reptiles, such as turtles and lizards, with any such degree of revulsion. We are attracted through prepared learning to find beauty in a stream-crossed parkland, and counterprepared to do the same for the interior of dark forests.

Magni, Thor’s son, is the first to find one of the things in the long grass, and once he finds it, he knows what it is. It is a golden chess piece, the kind the gods played with when the gods still lived. It is a tiny golden carving of Odin, the all-father, on his high throne: the king. They find more of them. Here is Thor, holding his hammer. There is Heimdall, his horn at his lips. Frigg, Odin’s wife, is the queen. Balder holds up a little golden statue. “That one looks like you,” Modi tells him. “It is me,” says Balder. “It is me long ago, before I died, when I was of the Aesir.” They will find other pieces in the grass, some beautiful, some less so.

This “ability” to explain that which we cannot predict, even in the absence of any additional information, represents an important, though subtle, flaw in our reasoning. It leads us to believe that there is a less uncertain world than there actually is, and that we are less bright than we actually might be. For if we can explain tomorrow what we cannot predict today, without any added information except the knowledge of the actual outcome, then this outcome must have been determined in advance and we should have been able to predict it. The fact that we couldn’t is taken as an indication of our limited intelligence rather than of the uncertainty that is in the world.

Richard Wiseman,"Favors have their strongest effect when they occur between people who don’t know each other very well, and when they are small but thoughtful. When people go to a great deal of effort to help someone else, the recipient can often feel an uncomfortable pressure to reciprocate. In a sense, by giving too much at the beginning, one person places the other in a difficult position because the law of reciprocity states that the recipient has to give even more in return. Motivation is also important, as recipients can often experience a drop in self-esteem if they think they are being helped because they are believed not to have the ability to be successful by themselves35 or if they attribute the favor to an ulterior motive.36 So, for maximum persuasion, remember: save your favors for strangers, it really is the thought that counts, and the favor has to appear to come from the heart, not the head.",59 Seconds,,,page 58 (Location 877-884),,"June 5, 2017 12:33 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3304

Unknown,"Throughout TMS Smith draws vivid vignettes of other such exemplars of characters exhibiting excellence in virtue (TMS VI.ii.intro.2; TMS VI.iii.28; TMS I.i.4.3; TMS VI.ii.2.14). All these characters have particular, cultivated virtues, practices, and, especially, mental dispositions associated with them. This further suggests that Smith is not simply a monist but a sort of moral pluralist who thinks society needs people with a variety of virtues.19 As Colin Heydt has emphasized, Smith’s vivid drawings of exemplars do not function merely as descriptions, but are meant to be instructive.20 An older generation of scholars tended to cite a passage from an extended footnote by Smith against the very idea of a normative dimension to TMS (TMS II.i.5.10). But in context, Smith is making a distinction between an inquiry into the “principles” upon which “a perfect being” would judge, and an inquiry into the principles by which “so weak and imperfect a creature as man” in fact judges. That is to say, he is claiming that for his enterprise a realistic human anthropology is required, rather than one beyond our reach.

Housing Authority memberships were ""nonpaying,"" but in Shanahan's case that adjective may have applied only to salary. Within a remarkably short time after he was sworn in, the word was out around town, not only among contractors but among architects, landscape architects, engineers, insurance brokers, real estate appraisers—among, in fact, every profession whose members wanted work from the Authority: You had ""to do business with Tom Shanahan""— do your banking at Shanahan's bank and kick back a portion of your profits to Shanahan, presumably for the Democratic Party—or forget about your chances. And even after you had obtained an Authority contract, the word went, your business with Shanahan was not finished; when you submitted the bill for your work, further payoffs would be required—or somehow the bill would keep getting lost in the Authority's files, and you would not get paid. The banker quickly became, in the words of one reform Democrat, ""one of the most notorious boodle boys around town."" Warren Moscow, who was able to do his perceiving from an excellent vantage point—he was executive director of the Housing Authority for two years—could say of the banker: He was a very personable guy, but I would say that ethically Tom left something to be desired all the way down the line. ... It was common knowledge—no, I won't say common knowledge, it was common gossip—that an architect who wanted to get an assignment from the Housing Authority had to turn $15,000 over to Tom Shanahan, theoretically for the Democratic Party. ""Theoretically,"" Moscow said—and the meaning behind that word was echoed by others who came into contact with Tom Shanahan, for even insiders who took the relationship of money and politics as a matter of course were taken aback by Shanahan's greed; ""we all knew what Shanahan was,"" Monroe Goldwater says, the wrinkles of his aged face forming a pattern of disgust at the recollection. If little publicity attended Shanahan's rise in banking, less attended his rise in politics. For years, there was scarcely a mention of his name in political stories in New York newspapers; there is no mention at all in the supposedly definitive history of Tammany Hall.

The effect worked just as well with men and women, regardless of the degree to which the seller’s final price was above the amount originally offered by the participant.

Our mortal lives are part of a larger span of existence, in which we will continue to participate after our deaths. It’s an attractive story. You can see why someone would believe it, and work to reconcile it with what science has taught us about the nature of reality. Here’s a different story. The universe is not a miracle. It simply is, unguided and unsustained, manifesting the patterns of nature with scrupulous regularity. Over billions of years it has evolved naturally, from a state of low entropy toward increasing complexity, and it will eventually wind down to a featureless equilibrium. We are the miracle, we human beings. Not a break-the-laws-of-physics kind of miracle; a miracle in that it is wondrous and amazing how such complex, aware, creative, caring creatures could have arisen in perfect accordance with those laws.

Martin Seligman,"Richard Dawkins’s 1976 book The Selfish Gene is emblematic of the dogma that natural selection works only through a solitary individual’s superior survival and reproductive prowess edging other competing individuals out of the gene pool. Individual selection works well to explain a lot about motivation and behavior, but altruism is an explosive puzzle for selfish-gene theorists. Their way out is to postulate “kinship altruism”: the more genes you have in common with the object of your altruism, the more likely you will act altruistically. You may lay down your life for an identical twin, but less readily for a nonidentical sibling (or fraternal twin) or a parent, only remotely for a first cousin, and not at all for an unrelated person. This convoluted argument flies in the face of ordinary altruism (the fact that nothing makes us feel better than helping another person) and heroic altruism (for example, Christians hiding Jews in their attics in German-occupied European countries during World War II). So common is altruism toward strangers that it led Dacher Keltner to claim in his eye-opening book that we are “Born to be good.” Darwin, quoted above, considered an additional evolutionary pressure, one that I believe fills out the picture: group selection. He postulated that if one group (comprised of genetically unrelated individuals) outsurvives or outreproduces a competing group, the winning group’s entire gene pool will multiply.",Flourish,,,page 169 (Location 2582-2592),,"July 26, 2015 6:19 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",2356

William Taubman,"Raisa Gorbachev’s “sociology with a human face,” as she called it, deepened her understanding of “real life,” particularly that of the old women she found living in every fourth or fifth peasant hut. These women had lost everything in the war. They “had never known the happiness of love or the joy of motherhood,” and now they were “living out their lives alone in old, tumbledown houses that were also at the end of their days.” Yet, the majority of them “had not become bitter, did not hate the whole world and had not withdrawn into themselves, but had preserved the selflessness and sympathy for the misfortunes and sorrows of others that have always animated the Russian woman’s heart.” Sounds sentimental? Well, she was. Late one evening she knocked on the door of an old woman. After answering Raisa’s questions, the woman sighed and asked, “How it is, daughter, that you’re so painfully thin?” “Oh no, [that’s] just my usual weight,” Raisa answered. “I suppose you haven’t got a husband,” the woman persisted. “Yes, I have.” “I suppose he drinks?” she sighed. “No.” “He beats you up?” “Certainly not.” “Come on, daughter, why try to deceive me? I’ve lived a long time and I know people don’t go round from door to door unless they’re driven to it.”84 On another occasion, when interviewing a lively, spirited Cossack woman, Raisa asked what held her family together: love, friendship, love of children, or—another possibility—sex? “What’s that? Raisa explained: “It’s your intimate relations with your husband.” And when that, too, drew a blank, she further elaborated: “Well, you know, a husband and wife have a personal relationship. Well, never mind.” Raisa added, intending to leave the conversation right there. “No,” said the woman. “Write it down: What the hell use is a man if not for that?”85",Gorbachev,"Funny, Men, Russia, Sex",,page 150 (Location 2292-2310),,"November 25, 2017 11:31 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3708

Sean Carroll,"It’s hard to doubt that the absence of evil would be taken as very strong evidence in favor of the existence of God. If humanity simply evolved according to natural selection, without any divine guidance or interference, we would expect to inherit a wide variety of natural impulses—some for good, some for not so good. The absence of evil in the world would be hard to explain under atheism, but relatively easy under theism, so it would count as evidence for the existence of God. But if that’s true, the fact that we do experience evil is unambiguously evidence against the existence of God. If the likelihood of no evil is larger under theism, then the likelihood of evil is larger under atheism, so evil’s existence increases our credence that atheism is correct. Put in those terms, it’s easy to come up with features of our universe that provide evidence for atheism over theism. Imagine a world in which miracles happened frequently, rather than rarely or not at all. Imagine a world in which all of the religious traditions from around the globe independently came up with precisely the same doctrines and stories about God. Imagine a universe that was relatively small, with just the sun and moon and Earth, no other stars or galaxies. Imagine a world in which religious texts consistently provided specific, true, nonintuitive pieces of scientific information. Imagine a world in which human beings were completely separate from the rest of biological history. Imagine a world in which souls survived after death, and frequently visited and interacted with the world of the living, telling compelling stories of life in heaven. Imagine a world that was free of random suffering. Imagine a world that was perfectly just, in which the relative state of happiness of each person was precisely proportional to their virtue. In any of those worlds, diligent seekers of true ontology would quite rightly take those aspects of reality as evidence for God’s existence. It follows, as the night the day, that the absence of these features is evidence in favor of atheism.",The Big Picture,,,page 145 (Location 2211-2225),,"May 10, 2017 10:57 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3195

The average enjoyment rating of the handsomely paid group was a measly 2 out of 10, while the modestly paid group’s average rating proved to be a whopping 8.5. It seemed that those who had been paid well had thought, “Well, let me see, people usually pay me to do things that I don’t enjoy. I was paid a large amount, so I must dislike cleaning the park.” In contrast, those who received less money thought, “I don’t need to be paid much to do something I enjoy.

Siddhartha Mukherjee,"“We suggest that the vast catalog of cancer cell genotypes is a manifestation of six essential alterations in cell physiology that collectively dictate malignant growth.” 1. Self-sufficiency in growth signals: cancer cells acquire an autonomous drive to proliferate—pathological mitosis—by virtue of the activation of oncogenes such as ras or myc. 2. Insensitivity to growth-inhibitory (antigrowth) signals: cancer cells inactivate tumor suppressor genes, such as retinoblastoma (Rb), that normally inhibit growth 3. Evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis): cancer cells suppress and inactivate genes and pathways that normally enable cells to die. 4. Limitless replicative potential: cancer cells activate specific gene pathways that render them immortal even after generations of growth. 5. Sustained angiogenesis: cancer cells acquire the capacity to draw out their own supply of blood and blood vessels—tumor angiogenesis. 6. Tissue invasion and metastasis: cancer cells acquire the capacity to migrate to other organs, invade other tissues, and colonize these organs, resulting in their spread throughout the body.",The Emperor of All Maladies,,,page 550 (Location 8431-8446),,"December 28, 2016 9:55 AM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3004

The future president of the post-war Federal Republic of Germany captured the dual nature of the Nazi movement. On the one hand, Heuss found, it inhabited a world of strong emotions and passions. These were evident in the Führer cult, the pseudo-religious faith followers invested in one man and his world view, and the mass psychosis triggered by his public appearances. On the other hand, though, there was the bureaucratic apparatus, the strongly organised, highly efficient party machinery aimed solely at acquiring political power. “Rationalistic power calculations coexist side by side with unbridled emotions,” wrote Heuss, who identified the same contradiction in Hitler himself. Hitler was, on the one hand, a “master of emotional ecstasy combining the techniques of the trained mass psychologist and someone inspired by the primeval passion that comes from the exuberance of mass emotion.” On the other hand, Heuss regarded Hitler simply as “a politician who wants power.”",Hitler,,,page 371 (Location 5683-5690),,"February 13, 2017 12:11 AM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3065

There’s a huge void between the simpler cells of bacteria and archaea and the more complex ones of eukaryotes, and life has managed to cross that void exactly once in four billion years. Since then, the countless bacteria and archaea in the world, all evolving at breakneck speed, have never again managed to produce a eukaryote. How could that possibly be? Other complex structures, from eyes to armour to many-celled bodies, have evolved on many independent occasions but the eukaryotic cell is a one-off innovation. That’s because, as Lane and others argue, the merger that created it – the one between an archaeon and a bacterium – was so breathtakingly improbable that it has never been duplicated, or at least never with success.

Sean Carroll,"Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision making, has popularized dividing how we think into two modes of thought, dubbed System 1 and System 2. (The terms were originally introduced by Keith Stanovich and Richard West.) System 1 includes all the various modules churning away below the surface of our conscious awareness. It is automatic, “fast,” intuitive thinking, driven by unconscious reactions and heuristics—rough-and-ready strategies shaped by prior experience. When you manage to make your coffee in the morning or drive from home to work without really paying attention to what you are doing, it’s System 1 that is in charge. System 2 is our conscious, “slow,” rational mode of thinking. It demands attention; when you’re concentrating on a hard math problem, that’s System 2’s job. As we go through the day, the vast majority of work being done in our brain belongs to System 1, despite our natural tendency to give credit to our self-aware System 2. Kahneman compares System 2 to “a supporting character who believes herself to be the lead actor and often has little idea of what’s going on.” Or in the words of neuroscientist David Eagleman, “Your consciousness is like a tiny stowaway on a transatlantic steamship, taking credit for the journey without acknowledging the massive engineering underfoot.”",The Big Picture,,,page 309 (Location 4731-4741),,"May 21, 2017 10:37 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3224

I do not believe that Nyx gives a shit whether or not Leone lives or dies. All Nyx wants is revenge, and yet Nyx speaks of revenge as a portal back to “love.” Whose love? Where? I want to get up to Leone so badly I have shredded the insides of my cheeks from chewing at them so impatiently. We make camp underground in all the caves Leone and I have lived in and more, sometimes finding evidence that others had been there, too, or maybe it was just the trace of things before or during the Wars. It is impossible to tell. Long-deserted fire pits and bone fragments, petroglyphs and the metal carcasses of weapons and vehicles and machines meant for killing, irrigation system remains and adobe structures and lighting and power systems and underground gardens gone crackled and black. Caches of long-spoiled food or irradiated stuff, burned-up bones of people in heaps or scattered like some great carnivorous bird had shat them across land masses. Once we found a tandem bicycle on its side, red and flat-tired, but with spokes intact. For some reason the bike crushed me. It reminded me that individual humans were always yearning for an other. The old ache in my chest. After seeing traces of people for so long, believing most of them dead, it was still shocking if what Peter said was true. That an entire group existed . . . no way to know without looking. Survivors be damned; my only impulse to live rests in the body of Leone. Graves. We see graves everywhere. Something else that haunts me: the graves, they all have different depths. I don’t know what, if anything, it means. There is no hierarchy to death, to grief, to the end of life. The small graves of children, shallower than the graves of adults—does it really mean anything different? Did decomposition happen more quickly for children? In any case, they remind me of the children I buried who died where they lay, the children I raised from the dead only to watch them drop to dirt, but not before they each looked me in the eye with one question: Why couldn’t you save me? There is a recurring dream I keep having that seems to be telling me something. When I was a child, it seemed beautiful: a white lady in space who spun stories like spiderwebs. Roomfuls of stories. And the ink of space surrounding her made her glow all the more, like some kind of moonwoman, her skin radiating night light. The stars seemed to carry her voice. During the Wars, the dream came to me differently. I don’t mean the dream changed; it did not. But how I felt within the dream changed. Suddenly the woman’s stories seemed urgent. Her eyes wider and more focused. Her mouth more deliberate. Her words heavier. Once I thought I even heard her call to me, say my name. But I can’t be sure. Someone else’s voice had woken me for battle. So it’s hard to say whose voice I really heard. It’s just that some part of me wanted it to be hers. I thought I heard the name Christ. I thought it was her name. Most recently the dream has turned brutal. The woman is still beautiful, still spinning stories, still embedded within the night and stars. But the pull of her voice is so intense I can feel it in my chest and abdomen. The stories are not for little girls. The stories say, Get up. Now. The stories say, Turn your head away from everything you’ve known. Look down. At the dirt itself. Mother. Sister. Daughter. Her name, the woman, I know now it is Christine.

Sean Carroll,"As we go through our lives, we don’t see random objects popping into existence. It might be forgivable to think that, at least with a high degree of credence, the universe itself shouldn’t simply pop into existence. But there are two very substantial mistakes lurking beneath that innocent-sounding idea. The first mistake is that saying that the universe had a beginning is not the same as saying it popped into existence. The latter formulation, which is natural from an everyday point of view, leans heavily on a certain way of thinking about time. For something to pop into existence implies that at an earlier moment it was not there, and at a later moment it was. But when we’re talking about the universe, that “earlier” moment simply does not exist. There is not a moment in time where there is no universe, and another moment in time where there is; all moments in time are necessarily associated with an existing universe. The question is whether there can be a first such moment, an instant of time prior to which there were no other instants. That’s a question our intuitions just aren’t up to addressing. Said another way: even if the universe has a first moment of time, it’s wrong to say that it “comes from nothing.” That formulation places into our mind the idea that there was a state of being, called “nothing,” which then transformed into the universe. That’s not right; there is no state of being called “nothing,” and before time began, there is no such thing as “transforming.” What there is, simply, is a moment of time before which there were no other moments.",The Big Picture,,,page 194 (Location 2969-2981),,"May 12, 2017 11:19 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 4:50 PM",3201

That’s a complete description of what is going on; there’s no real difference in conditions in the universe from place to place. In the far future the entropy will be very high, but conditions will once again be simple. If we wait long enough, the universe will appear cold and empty, and will have regained its smoothness.

Awaken it for someone for whom you spontaneously feel unequivocal goodwill and tenderness, such as your mother, your child, your spouse, your dog. “May (name) enjoy happiness and the root of happiness.” Awaken loving-kindness for someone slightly more distant, such as a friend or neighbor, again saying their name and aspiring for their happiness, using the same words. Awaken loving-kindness for someone about whom you feel neutral or indifferent, using the same words. Awaken loving-kindness for someone you find difficult or offensive. Let the loving-kindness grow big enough to include all the beings in the five steps above. (This step is called “dissolving the barriers.”) Say, “May I, my beloved, my friend, the neutral person, the difficult person all together enjoy happiness and the root of happiness.” Extend loving-kindness toward all beings throughout the universe.

Nietzsche described man as ‘the sick animal’ because he is provided with everything and yet is infected with an insatiable need for the metaphysical that can never be assuaged.

Tara Brach,"Guided Meditation: Facing Difficulty and Naming What Is True Mental noting deepens our attention so we are better able to meet painful emotions and intense sensations with a wakeful and healing presence. Sitting comfortably, close your eyes and take a few full breaths. Is there some situation or issue in your life that you are grappling with? You might focus on an interpersonal conflict, financial pressure or stress at work. Ask yourself “How am I feeling about this?” and bring a receptive presence to your body. Pay particular attention to your throat, chest and stomach. Is there tightness, pressure, heat? Is there a word that describes your experience—sad, restless, shaky, afraid? There is no need to strain, to run through a mental thesaurus to find the “right” word. Just notice what word arises in awareness and mentally repeat it to yourself in a soft tone. Sometimes there is no label that fits the mix of feelings that you are experiencing. In this case you might name one of the more dominant elements in the mix. The point is not to nail something down by getting it right, but to keep paying attention to the felt sense of what is real in this particular moment. After naming your experience, gently ask yourself, while paying close attention to the sensations in your body, “Is this true? Does this word describe what I am feeling now? If not, is there another word?” Continue in this way—mentally noting your unfolding experience and checking your body to see what is most true in this moment. You may get lost for a time in thoughts.

Tara Brach,"Guided Meditation: The Power of Yes Sitting quietly, close your eyes and take a few full breaths. Bring to mind a current situation that elicits a reaction of anger, fear or grief. It may be a rift with your partner, the loss of a loved one, a power struggle with your child, a chronic illness, a hurtful behavior that you now regret. The more fully you get in touch with the charged essence of the story, the more readily you can access the feelings in your heart and throughout your body. What is it about this situation that provokes the strongest feelings? You might see a particular scene in your mind, hear words that were spoken, recognize a belief you hold about how this situation reflects on you or what it means for your future. Be especially aware of the feelings in your stomach, chest and throat. In order to see firsthand what happens when you resist experience, begin by experimenting with saying no. As you connect with the pain you feel in the situation you have chosen, mentally direct a stream of no at the feelings. No to the unpleasantness of fear, anger, shame or grief. Let the word carry the energy of no—rejecting, pushing away what you are experiencing. As you say no, notice what this resistance feels like in your body. Do you feel tightness, pressure? What happens to the painful feelings as you say no? What happens to your heart? Imagine what your life would be like if, for the next hours, weeks and months, you continued to move through the world with the thoughts and feelings of no. Take a few deep breaths and let go by relaxing through the body, opening your eyes or shifting your posture a bit. Now take a few moments to call to mind again the painful situation you’d previously chosen, remembering the images, words, beliefs and feelings connected with it. This time let yourself be the Buddha under the bodhi tree, the Buddha inviting Mara to tea. Direct a stream of the word yes at your experience. Agree to the experience with yes. Let the feelings float, held in the environment of yes. Even if there are waves of no—fear or anger that arise with the painful situation or even from doing this exercise—that’s okay. Let these natural reactions be received in the larger field of yes. Yes to the pain. Yes to the parts of us that want the pain to go away. Yes to whatever thoughts or feelings arise. Notice your experience as you say yes. Is there softening, opening and movement in your body? Is there more space and openness in your mind? What happens to the unpleasantness as you say yes? Does it get more intense? Does it become more diffuse? What happens to your heart as you say yes? What would your experience be in the hours, weeks and months to come, if you could bring the spirit of yes to the inevitable challenges and sorrows of life? Continue to sit now, releasing thoughts and resting in an alert, relaxed awareness.

The women of the neighbourhood would sit silently and respectfully, their knees pressed together, their heads covered, rapt in thought. If any of the children wandering around made so much as a peep, they were hushed immediately. When it was waxing day, things were quite the opposite. With no men around, the women would wear the skimpiest of clothes. They would slouch on the sofa with their legs apart, their arms bare, their eyes glittering with repressed mischief.

Tara Brach,"Guided Meditation: Embracing Life with a Smile The compassionate Buddha is often seen in statues and pictures with a slight smile as he embraces the ten thousand joys and sorrows. When we meditate with the spirit of a smile, we awaken our natural capacity for unconditional friendliness. Sitting comfortably, close your eyes and let the natural rhythm of the breath help you to relax. Take a few moments to let go of obvious places of tightness and tension. Now, listening to sounds and becoming aware of the space around you, allow the curved image of a smile to appear in your mind. Notice how gentleness, kindness, openness and ease arise with the idea of a smile. Sense the curved relaxed smile fill your mind and extend outward into space. Now imagine a smile at the corner of both eyes and feel the sensations that arise there. Allow your brow to be smooth, the flesh around your eyes to be soft and relaxed. You might sense your eyes floating gently as in a pool of warm water. Continue to soften and let go through the whole area around the eyes. Can you perceive a relaxed brightness there? Now bring a small but real smile to your lips—the half-smile of the Buddha—and allow the feeling to relax the muscles of your face. Let the jaw be relaxed and loose, and let the tip of the tongue lightly touch the roof of the mouth. Feel now how the eyes are smiling . . . the mouth is smiling . . . Bring the image of a smile to your throat and notice what happens. There might be a relaxing and opening. If there is tightness allow it to be held in the sense of the smile. Feel again the corners of your eyes smiling, your mouth smiling, your throat smiling. Let the smile drift down into your chest. Imagine the shape and feeling of a smile spreading through the area of your heart. Whatever feelings might be there, allow them to float in the openness and kindness of a smile. Continuing to relax, sense the smile in your heart sending ripples of ease throughout your body—through the shoulders, along the arms and down into the torso and legs. Can you feel the openness and vibrancy of a smile at the navel, the genitals, the base of the spine? Allow yourself to rest in the spacious and kind awareness that is engendered by a smile. When thoughts, sensations or emotions arise, can you sense how they are held with unconditional friendliness? If your mind wanders or you find yourself tightening, you can gently reestablish the smile in your mind, eyes, mouth and heart. With practice, you will find that the smile is a simple and powerful way to reawaken the heart at any moment of the day.

There must be a necessary and visible bond between virtue and knowledge, between faith and morality.

Socrates is ‘the mystagogue of science’ in whose eye the lovely gleam of madness never glowed. Socrates instigated the ‘unimaginable, universal greed for knowledge, stretching across most of the cultured world, and presenting itself as the true task for anyone of higher abilities. [Socrates] led science on to the high seas, from which it could never again be driven completely … for the first time, thanks to this universality, a common network of thought was stretched over the whole globe, with prospects of encompassing even the laws of the entire solar system.’3",I Am Dynamite!,"Art, Science",,page 115 (location 1756-1764),,"February 24, 2020 9:41 PM (GMT)",,"March 15, 2020 5:58 PM",4298

Following a prescribed tick, one will arrive at a particular place, certain that an event will begin at that set time. They seem to say, ‘Brethren, an arm of divinity is amongst us, and it has set its purpose at twelve forty, so we must submit to its dictates.’ If something happens, the White Man obliges himself to ascribe it to time – ‘On this day, July twentieth, 1985, such-and-such happened.’ Whereas time to the august fathers was something that was both spiritual and human. It was in part beyond their control and was ordered by the same force that brought the universe into existence. When they wanted to discern the beginning of a season or parse the age of a day or measure the length of years, they looked to nature. Has the sun risen? If it has, then it must be day. Is the moon full? If it is, then we must gather our best clothing, empty our barns and get ready to celebrate the new year! If in fact the sound we hear is thunderclaps, then surely the drought must have ended and the raining season must be upon us. But also, the wise fathers believed that there is a part of time that man can control, a means by which man can subject time to his own will.

Thomas Piketty,"By the eighteenth century Europe had exhausted the supply of American silver with which it had paid for its trade with China and India, and Europeans feared they might have nothing to sell in exchange for imported silk, textiles, porcelain, spices, and tea from the two Asian giants. The British accordingly attempted to intensify their growing of opium in India to export to Chinese resellers and consumers who had developed a taste for it. The opium trade grew substantially over the course of the eighteenth century, and in 1773 the East India Company established its monopoly over the production and export of the drug from Bengal. The Qing emperor, seeing the enormous increase in opium imports and under pressure from his bureaucracy and enlightened public opinion to stop it, tried to enforce a ban on the recreational use of opium in 1729. Subsequent emperors took a more proactive approach for obvious public health reasons. In 1839 the emperor ordered his envoy in Canton not only to end the traffic but also to burn existing opium stores without delay. In late 1839 and early 1840, the British press launched a vigorous anti-China campaign, which was paid for by opium dealers; articles denounced China’s unacceptable violation of British property rights and attack on the principle of free trade.",Capital and Ideology,,,page 509 (location 7802-7811),,"June 12, 2020 9:55 PM (GMT)",,"January 10, 2021 4:23 PM",4460

In other words, people in a wealthy nation do not feel any better than those in a poor one. How is this possible if wealth makes us happy?

Tara Brach,"Guided Meditation: Developing an Embodied Presence A mindful body scan is a valuable pathway to embodied presence. Sitting comfortably, close your eyes and take several long, deep breaths. Then rest in the natural flow of your breath and allow your body and mind to begin to settle. With a relaxed, open awareness, now begin a gradual and thorough scan of your entire body. Place your attention at the top of your head and without looking for anything in particular, feel the sensations there. Then letting your attention move down, feel the sensations on the back of your head, on either side of your head, through your ears. Notice the sensations through your forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks, jaw and mouth. Be as slow and thorough as you like. As you continue the scan, be careful not to use your eyes to direct your attention. (This will only create tension.) Rather, connect directly with sensations by feeling the body from within the body. In certain parts of the body it is common to feel numbness or for there to be no noticeable sensations. Let your attention remain in those areas for a few moments in a relaxed and easeful way. You may find that as your attention deepens, when you revisit these places, you become increasingly aware of sensations. Images or thoughts will naturally arise. Notice them passing through and gently return your attention to the sensations. Let your intention be to release all ideas and experience your physical aliveness exactly as it is. Place your attention on the area of your neck and throat, noticing without any judgment whatever sensations you feel. Be aware of each of your shoulders from the inside. Then let your attention move slowly down your arms, feeling the sensations and aliveness there. Bring awareness to your hands, making sure they are resting in an easy and effortless way. Feel each finger from the inside, the palms, the backs of the hands—noticing tingling, pulsing, pressure, warmth or cold. Arrive in the life of your body. Now place your awareness on your chest, exploring the sensations in that whole area. Slowly allow your awareness to sink down into your stomach. With a soft, receptive awareness, take some moments to feel the sensations in your abdomen. Place your attention on your upper back, feeling the sensations in the area around your shoulder blades. Moving down, be aware of the mid- and lower back, and then the entire spinal column. Continuing to let awareness sweep down the body, feel the sensations that arise through the hips, buttocks, genitals. What are the actual sensations that are arising? Move slowly down through the legs, feeling them from within. Explore the sensations in your feet and toes. At the places where your body touches the chair, cushion or floor, feel the sensations of contact, pressure and temperature. Now open your attention to include your body in a comprehensive way. Be aware of the body as a field of changing sensations. Can you sense the subtle energy field that vitalizes and gives life to every cell, every organ in your body? Is there anything in your experience that is solid, unmoving? Is there any center or boundary to the field of sensation? Is there any solid self you can locate that possesses these sensations? What or who is aware of experience? As you rest in awareness of your whole body, if particular sensations call your attention, bring a soft and allowing attention to them. Don’t manage or manipulate your experience, don’t grasp or push anything away. Simply open to the changing dance of sensations, feeling your life from the inside out. If no particular sensations call your attention, remain open to feeling energy simultaneously in all parts of the body. If thoughts carry your attention away, gently note, “Thinking, thinking,” and then reconnect with the energetic field of aliveness.

Tara Brach,"Guided Meditation: Meeting Fear with an Open and Engaged Presence You will benefit from cultivating an open and engaged presence as described in this exercise during those times when you are not experiencing feelings and sensations linked to trauma. If your fear is related to trauma or feels overwhelming, the practice of being with fear may lead to emotional flooding and be inappropriate. In these cases, rather than facing fear on your own, it is important that you seek support from trusted friends, guidance from a meditation teacher or skillful help from a therapist. Find a comfortable place to sit where the view is not distracting or confined. You might look out a window or at a blank wall or an uncluttered space in your house. With your eyes open, rest your gaze on a point slightly above your line of sight. Soften your eyes so that they are unfocused and you are also receiving the images on the periphery of your vision. Relax the flesh around your eyes, letting your eyeballs float gently in their sockets. Take a few moments to do a quick scan through your body, releasing any tension, especially in the shoulders, hands and belly. Now with a receptive awareness, begin noticing the arising and disappearing of sounds in the space around you. Spend a minute or two simply listening. Be aware of nearby sounds, noticing their beginnings and endings. Notice the spaces between sounds. Become aware of more far-off sounds, then open to the most distant sounds you can detect. Relax and open into the awareness that includes even the most distant sounds you detect. Sense how everything you perceive—sights, sounds, tastes, sensations, moods—arises and passes away within boundless awareness. Continue with your eyes open, downcast or, if you prefer, closed. Let your attention rest softly on the out-breath, letting go into space with each exhale. Follow each breath as it dissolves outward into open space. Feel that your entire body and mind could follow the out-breath and dissolve into space. Sense that your awareness is mingling with endless space, absolutely open, boundless. As the breath comes in, simply rest in openness, listening and awake, doing nothing. Then again let go outward with the exhale. Inhaling, rest in receptive, spacious awareness. Exhaling, relax into openness. You can meditate with the breath in this way for as long as you like. Now resting in this natural openness, bring to mind a situation that evokes fear. Ask yourself: “What is the worst part of this situation? What am I really afraid of?” While your inquiry may arouse a story, if you stay alert to the sensations that arise in your body, the story becomes a gateway to accessing your feelings more fully. Paying particular attention to your throat, chest and stomach area, discover how fear expresses itself in you. You might kindly invite the fear: “Be as much as you really are.” Now, as you breathe in, let the breath directly touch the place of most pain and vulnerability. Bring your full attention to the sensations of fear. As you breathe out, sense the openness of space that holds your experience. Feel the fear as if floating and untwisting itself in this openness. What does the fear actually feel like? Where in your body do you feel it most strongly? Do the sensations change or move to different parts of your body? What is their shape? What color, if any? How do you experience fear in your mind? Does it feel contracted? Is your mind racing or confused? With each in-breath, feel your willingness to gently connect with the waves of life that are unpleasant and disturbing. Breathing out, let go and feel how the waves of fear belong to a larger world, an ocean of openness. You can surrender your fear into this vast and tender space of healing. Breathing in, you contact the immediate sensations with a kind and clear attention. Breathing out, you realize your belonging to the boundless awareness that has room for all of life’s fears. If you feel defended or numb, focus on your physical sensations and contact them fully with the in-breath. If you feel as if the fear is “too much,” emphasize breathing out—letting go into openness and safety. It can help to begin again by listening to sounds or opening your eyes. You might remember the spaciousness of the world or reflect with compassion on all those who at this moment are also feeling fear. You might bring to mind a person or spiritual figure or place in nature that conveys a sense of safety. Once you feel that you belong to a larger world, again attend to the way that fear expresses through your body and mind. With time, you will discover an artful balancing of touching fear and remembering openness.",Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame,,,page 184 (location 2737-2772),,"May 10, 2020 3:49 PM (GMT)",,"January 10, 2021 4:23 PM",4435

"Obioma, Chigozie","that time is divine – an entity to whose will man must submit. Following a prescribed tick, one will arrive at a particular place, certain that an event will begin at that set time. They seem to say, ‘Brethren, an arm of divinity is amongst us, and it has set its purpose at twelve forty, so we must submit to its dictates.’ If something happens, the White Man obliges himself to ascribe it to time – ‘On this day, July twentieth, 1985, such-and-such happened.’ Whereas time to the august fathers was something that was both spiritual and human. It was in part beyond their control and was ordered by the same force that brought the universe into existence. When they wanted to discern the beginning of a season or parse the age of a day or measure the length of years, they looked to nature. Has the sun risen? If it has, then it must be day. Is the moon full? If it is, then we must gather our best clothing, empty our barns and get ready to celebrate the new year! If in fact the sound we hear is thunderclaps, then surely the drought must have ended and the raining season must be upon us. But also, the wise fathers believed that there is a part of time that man can control, a means by which man can subject time to his own will. To them, time is not divine; it is an element, like air, that can be put to use. They can use air to put out fires, blow insects out of people’s eyes, or even cause flutes to produce music. This is the same way that time can be subject to the will of man – when a group among the fathers says, for instance, ‘We, the elders of Amaokpu, have a meeting at sunset.’ That time is expansive. It could be the beginning of sunset, or its middle, or its end. But even this does not matter. What matters is that they know the number of those coming to the meeting. Those who arrive ahead of others wait, talk, laugh until everyone is there, and that’s when the meeting begins.",An Orchestra of Minorities,,,page 43 (location 653-666),,"March 27, 2020 10:37 PM (GMT)",,"January 10, 2021 4:23 PM",4399

Tara Brach,"At a weekend workshop I led on Radical Acceptance, one of the participants, Marian, shared her story about the shame and guilt that had tortured her. Marian’s daughter Christy, in recovery for alcoholism, had asked her mother to join her in therapy. As their sessions unfolded, Christy revealed that she had been sexually abused throughout her teen years by her stepfather, Marian’s second husband. When Marian was asleep or not at home, he’d enter Christy’s bedroom and lock the door so that her younger sister wouldn’t surprise them. Almost every week he would arrive drunk, demand that she give him oral sex and then swear her to silence. He told her that if word ever got out, he’d beat her so badly that she’d wish she’d never been born. He also threatened to start doing the same thing with Christy’s little sister. Sometimes he cried, saying that if Christy’s mother ever found out, it would destroy her. She’d probably kill herself. With each new revelation from her daughter, Marian felt her soul plunging deeper into a bottomless pit. Her days became a living nightmare. She would relentlessly rerun the mental movie of her husband sneaking into Christy’s room and forcing the girl sexually. Rage would overcome her and she would plot violent acts of vengeance against this man who had harmed her daughter. Only slowly did it dawn on her how much she herself was to blame. Imagining herself clueless, asleep downstairs after perhaps too much wine, Marian felt wracked by self-hatred. Her mind fueled her misery with its endless assaults of “If only I had known” and “How could I be so blind.” Compassion for herself was not only impossible, Marian was convinced it would have been wrong. She was the mother, she told herself. What had happened to Christy was her fault. She deserved to suffer. Then at one session what Marian had feared all along happened. Christy verbally attacked her. “You just slept through my whole adolescence,” she shouted. “I was being violated and had nowhere to turn. No one was there to take care of me.” Christy’s face was red and her hands clenched into tight fists. “There, I’ve done it. I’ve told you the truth and now you’ll disappear again. I was afraid to tell you then, and now I know why. You can’t handle the truth. You can’t handle me. You never could. I hate you,” screamed Christy. “I hate you. I hate you.” Marian felt the words pierce her heart. As she watched Christy dissolve into great heaving sobs, Marian knew what she’d heard was true. She had indeed hidden away from Christy’s pain by sleeping. She hadn’t been able to handle her daughter’s involvement with drugs, her clashes with teachers, her truancy and suspensions from school, because she couldn’t handle anything about her own life. Much like her first marriage, her relationship with her second husband had quickly disintegrated after he had an affair. Her way of managing depression was through drinking with her friends and oversleeping. By the time she entered therapy and finally divorced, both her girls had left home. Now she knew how tragically she had failed Christy and her sister, how she had failed in everything that was important. There was no reason to go on living. We have all harmed others and felt as if we were bad because of our actions. For Marian the unavoidable truth was that she had played a direct role in Christy’s suffering. When we, like Marian, face the truth that we have hurt others, sometimes severely, the feelings of guilt can tear us apart. Even when the damage is not so great, some of us still feel undeserving of compassion or redemption. At times like these, the only way to find compassion for ourselves is by reaching out to something larger than the self that feels so small and miserable. We might take refuge by calling on the Beloved, on Buddha or the Divine Mother, God or Jesus, the Great Spirit, Shiva or Allah. We reach toward the loving awareness that is great enough to offer comfort and safety to our broken being. As a Catholic, Marian had found through prayer moments of deep peace and communion with a loving God. But in her despair, she now felt alone in the universe. Sure God existed, but she felt too sinful and wretched to reach out to him. Thomas Merton writes, “True love and prayer are learned in the hour where prayer has become impossible and the heart has turned to stone.” Marian’s hour had come Fearing she might harm herself, Marian sought counsel from an elderly Jesuit priest who had been one of her teachers in college. Crying, she collapsed in the overstuffed chair he offered. “Please, please help me,” she pleaded. He listened to her story and sat quietly with her as she wept. When she calmed down, he gently took one of her hands and began drawing a circle in the center of her palm. “This,” he said, “is where you are living. It is painful—a place of kicking and screaming and deep, deep hurt. This place cannot be avoided, let it be.” Then he covered her whole hand with his. “But if you can,” he went on, “try also to remember this. There is a greatness, a wholeness that is the kingdom of God, and in this merciful space, your immediate life can unfold. This pain,” and he again touched the center of her palm, “is held always in God’s love. As you know both the pain and the love, your wounds will heal.” Marian felt as if a great wave of compassion was pouring through the hands of the priest and gently bathing her, inviting her to surrender into its caring embrace. As she gave her desperation to it, she knew she was giving herself to the mercy of God. The more she let go, the more she felt held. Yes, she had been blind, and ignorant, she had caused irreparable damage, but she wasn’t worthless, she wasn’t evil. Being held in the infinite compassion of God, she could find her way to her own heart. Feeling compassion for ourselves in no way releases us from responsibility for our actions. Rather, it releases us from the self-hatred that prevents us from responding to our life with clarity and balance. The priest was not advising Marian to ignore the pain or to deny that she had failed her daughter, but to open her heart to the love that could begin the healing. Now, rather than being locked inside her tormenting thoughts, Marian could remember the possibility of compassion. When remorse or self-hatred would arise, she would mentally say, “Please hold this pain.” When she felt her anguish as being held by God, she could face it without being ripped apart or wanting to destroy herself. As her mind began to settle and clear, Marian was able to reflect on what she could do, how she could help Christy. Two weeks later when they met again in a therapy session, Christy was guarded and cold. Silently, Marian took a seat next to her on the couch. When Christy didn’t withdraw, Marian moved a little closer. She told her she knew that she had failed her terribly. “I should have been there to protect and comfort you . . . and instead I let you down. I was so wrapped up in my own pain that I couldn’t see yours.” She paused, looking earnestly into her daughter’s eyes. “I can’t tell you how sorry I am. I know I can’t make your pain go away, Christy, but I want to be with you as you find yourself. I’m not going to disappear again.” Gently taking Christy’s hand, Marian told her the story of what had happened with the priest. Drawing a soft circle in the center of her palm, she whispered his words, “This place cannot be avoided. Let it be.” Then covering Christy’s hand with her own, she went on, “But in this merciful space that is the kingdom of God, your life can unfold.” By the time they embraced, both were in tears. Holding her sobbing child, Marian felt filled with a tender compassion—for both of them.

This of course does not mean that these cognitive constructs have nothing to teach us. It means, rather, that to learn from them, we must take this complexity and reflexivity into account. Furthermore, the questions that interest us, which pertain to the nature of the ideal social, economic, and political organization, are far too complex to allow answers to emerge from a simple “objective” examination of the “facts,” which inevitably reflect the limitations of past experiences and the incompleteness of our knowledge and of the deliberative processes to which we were exposed. Finally, it is entirely conceivable that the “ideal” regime (however we interpret the word “ideal”) is not unique and depends on specific characteristics of each society.

Talent in your chosen field plays a part, but always it is a matter of money and politics. That is the way things are here in the capital. If you were not born into a grand family and have ambition, then you join a guild and fight your way to the top. Now consider that very carefully because this is a choice that will decide the rest of your life for you: Is the Eggshaper Guild what you truly want? It is what I wanted, and I have achieved my goal. I am Grand Master. But look at the battles I have to fight on every level. I am surrounded with so many people seeking the same thing, seeking this seat in this office, that I cannot make an exception for someone as gifted as yourself because a hundred years ago I had a Master who went on to teach you. Is that sanity, Edeard? Is that the life you want for yourself? To have a dozen such considerations every day, to be unable to put a foot wrong, to continue a tradition no matter how dry and worthless it is because that is what supports you?

David Shariatmadari,"We have our own ways of dividing up the spectrum of sensation and feeling, and other cultures may do it quite differently. Words divide an analogue world into digital chunks. More than that, they can actually be “concept-forming,” according to the linguist Geoffrey Leech (who also provided the “steed,” “mount” and “gee-gee” examples above). The word “babysitter,” he pointed out, refers to something more than just someone who sits with a baby. It “institutionalizes” a new role: that of a family member, friend or professional who looks after your child while you are out. You might ask which comes first, the concept or the word? It’s a bit chicken and egg: an increasingly familiar set of circumstances calls out for a shorter, more convenient way of describing them, and the label distills that phenomenon into a concept. Regardless, the fact of naming has its own real-world effects. Babysitting becomes a more easily accessible idea as a result of its handy label; people may then decide to try to earn some extra money “babysitting,” whereas without this clearly defined role it might not have occurred to them to do so. Importantly, this doesn’t mean that languages without a word for “babysitter” can’t conceive of such a job. It just means it’s less normal, less available, less a widely recognized part of everyday life. Incidentally, it’s relatively rare to be able to pinpoint the moment of naming. One clear-cut example, which sheds some light on the chicken-and-egg problem, is the word “podcast.” Here’s",Don't Believe a Word,,,page 43 (location 655-667),,"August 3, 2020 9:36 PM (GMT)",,"January 10, 2021 4:23 PM",4476

William Manchester,"Already he was memorizing Macaulay’s tale of a man with two comrades barring a bridge to an army:19 Then out spake brave Horatius, The Captain of the Gate: “To every man upon this earth Death cometh soon or late. And how can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods?” Beginning at the age of seven, Churchill deliberately set out to change his nature, to prove that biology need not be destiny. Anthony Storr, the English psychiatrist and author of Human Aggression, concludes that he “was, to a marked extent, forcing himself to go against his own inner nature.”20 As a Victorian, Churchill believed he could be master of his fate, and that faith sustained him, but everything we have learned about human motivation since then underscores the immensity of his undertaking. W. H. Sheldon has delineated three dominant physiques, each with its concomitant personality traits. Of the three—ectomorphic (slight), mesomorphic (muscular), and endomorphic (fat)—Churchill clearly fell in the third category. His head was ponderous, his limbs small, his belly tumescent, his chest puny. His skin was so sensitive that he broke into a rash unless he slept naked at night between silk sheets. By day he could wear only silk underwear against his skin. Endomorphs are characteristically lazy, calculating, easygoing, and predictable. Churchill was none of these. He altered his emotional constitution to that of an athlete, projecting the image of a valiant, indomitable bulldog. At times along the way he despaired. In 1893 he wrote, “I am cursed with so feeble a body, that I can hardly support the fatigues of the day.” Yet he was determined to prove just as hardy as any mesomorph. In his teens he nearly killed himself while leaping from a bridge during a game of tag; he pitched down almost thirty feet and lay unconscious for three days. He fell again steeplechasing at Aldershot, and yet again when disembarking at Bombay, where he permanently injured a shoulder; for the rest of his active life he played polo, off and on, with his arm bound to his side. As a child he caught pneumonia. He suffered from chest ailments the rest of his life. He was allergic to anesthetics and periodically erupted in boils. Nevertheless, he refused to yield to human frailty. In his inner world there was no room for concessions to weakness. He never complained of fatigue. In his seventieth year he flew to councils of war overseas sprawled across a tick mattress on the floor of an unheated World War II bomber. During the ten years after V-E Day he suffered a heart attack, three bouts of pneumonia, two strokes, and two operations. Nevertheless, he continued to build the image of a tireless embodiment of machismo who ate, smoked, and drank, all to excess. It survives to this day. Actually, most of the stories about his alcohol intake are myth. It is true that he started each day with a scotch and soda. What is not generally known is that he made that drink last until lunch, and that the amount of liquor he put away over a twenty-four-hour day was surprisingly modest. You would never have known it to hear him talk. He wanted to be remembered as a two-bottle man, like Pitt, and he cultivated the yarns about his drinking with characteristic aplomb. Once he asked Frederick Lindemann—“the Prof,” a scientific wizard who later became Lord Cherwell—how many boxcars could be filled with the champagne he had drunk in his lifetime. The Prof replied: “Only part of one.” Churchill sighed. He said: “So little time and so much to achieve.”21 In his most famous photograph he is seen glaring at the camera, his jaw jutting like the butt end of a ham, the incarnation of defiant Britain. The Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh, who understood him, caught the expression by a trick. Just before he triggered the shutter, he reached out and yanked Churchill’s cigar from his mouth. What you really see in that picture is an endomorph rudely deprived of his pacifier. If you look closely, however, you may catch a glimpse of something else: a man ruled by his instincts. In triumphing over his physiognomy Churchill had become an aggressive extrovert, but at the same time he had developed into a rare type—C.",The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill Box Set Box Set,,,page 35 (location 525-565),,"October 18, 2020 7:57 PM (GMT)",,"January 10, 2021 4:23 PM",4497

Resting in this openness, now bring a more precise attention to the changing sensations in the area of pain. What is the experience actually like? Do you feel burning, aching, twisting, throbbing, tearing, stabbing? Does the pain feel like a knot, a constricting band? Does the area feel as if it is being pressed down or crushed by a great weight? Are the unpleasant sensations diffuse or focused in their intensity? How do they change as you observe them? Investigate with a nonreactive, soft attention. Allow the sensations you may feel as a solid block of pain to unfold and move in their natural dance of change. When resistance arises, relax again, reestablishing a sense of openness. Be aware of your entire body, including the areas that aren’t painful. Let the body become like open space, with plenty of room for unpleasant sensations to arise and dissolve, fade and intensify, move and change. No holding, no tension.

After all this time she figured the monk, now a man in the prime of life, must have attained some degree of enlightenment. So she decided to test him. Rather than taking his daily meal to him herself, she asked a beautiful young girl to deliver it. She instructed the girl to embrace the monk warmly—and then to report back to her how he responded. When the girl returned, she said that the monk had simply stood stock-still, as if frozen. The old woman then headed for the monk’s hut. What was it like, she asked him, when he felt the girl’s warm body against his? With some bitterness he answered, “Like a withering tree on a rock in winter, utterly without warmth.” Furious, the old woman threw him out and burned down his hut, exclaiming, “How could I have wasted all these years on such a fraud.” To",Radical Acceptance: Awakening the Love that Heals Fear and Shame,,,page 137 (location 2035-2042),,"March 24, 2020 9:28 PM (GMT)",,"January 10, 2021 4:23 PM",4383

It had taken the Mongols sixty years to conquer China; they subjugated all of Russia in three. Instead of occupying its cities, Batu simply immolated them, after putting everyone inside their walls to death. Beginning in 1237, he razed Riazan, Kolomna, Kostroma, Yaroslavl, Uglich, Kashin, Ksnyatin, Galich, Gorodets, Kozelsk, Rostov, Suzdal, Volokolamsk, Chernigov, Smolensk, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Yuriev-Polsky, Dmitrov, Torzhok and Tver—among the larger cities, only Vladimir and Pskov were left standing. His army cut down some 270,000 people in Moscow alone. The Mongols put to death every man, woman and child in the city of Vladimir and nearly depopulated the Dnieper region. In 1240, Batu reached Kiev. The most beautiful city in ancient Rus and its capital, Kiev was said to have exceeded western European cities in both size and splendor. It had been home to more than six hundred churches, and its noble families were related, by marriage or blood, to the monarchs of Byzantium, England and the Holy Roman Empire. After breaching Kiev’s walls and killing nearly everyone inside, Batu’s soldiers emptied the tombs as well, scattering the bones of the dead and smashing the skulls with their heels.

Nicholas A. Christakis,"Complicating matters, over time certain behaviors that previously were learned may actually become genetic. This is known as the Baldwin effect, and it works as follows: In any given generation of a species, some animals might be born, by chance, with gene variants that make it easier for them to learn a particular behavior. For instance, some birds might learn a song more easily than others because they have brains more capable of producing the typical introductory note of the song. If this behavior is adaptive (for example, if the song helps the birds attract mates), then it confers a fitness advantage on them, and the genes that make it easy to learn the behavior get reinforced and expand in frequency as the population reproduces. The same thing continues to happen. In each generation, those animals fare best who are most easily able to learn the target behavior, because they innately manifest more and more of it. Having acquired the innate capacity to produce the initial note, some birds might now be born with other gene variants that make it easier for them to produce the motifs of the song. These too could become innate, across generations, in response to selection. Eventually, over time, the entire behavior—and not just its predicates—comes to be encoded in the genes.117 What was previously a nongenetic action has become a genetically encoded one.",Blueprint,,,page 353 location 5408-5418,,"February 6, 2021 2:45 AM (GMT)",Kindle Import Timestamp 1632010442079,"September 19, 2021 10:20 AM",

Derek Sivers,"As a business owner, when you get screwed over by someone, you might be tempted to make a big grand policy that you think will prevent your ever getting screwed over again: One employee can’t focus and spends his time surfing the Web. Instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall so that nobody can go to unapproved sites ever again. It’s important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture. In the moment, you’re angry, focusing only on that one awful person who did you wrong. Your thinking is clouded. You start believing everyone is awful and the whole world is against you. This is a horrible time to make a new policy. When one customer wrongs you, remember the hundred thousand who did not. You’re lucky to own your own business. Life is good. You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Learn to shrug. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.",Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur,,,page 24 location 365-372,,"May 27, 2021 9:38 PM (GMT)",Kindle Import Timestamp 1632010442079,"September 19, 2021 10:20 AM",
